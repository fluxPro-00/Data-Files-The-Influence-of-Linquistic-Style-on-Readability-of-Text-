      "then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were\n",
      "filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and\n",

      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There\n",
      "was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that\n",
      "this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the\n",
      "locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it\n",
      "would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came\n",
      "upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a\n",
      "little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage\n",
      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n",
      "that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
      "doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\n",
      "I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
      "it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
      "telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly\n",
      "was not here before,\" said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the\n",
      "bottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed\n",
      "on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_'\n",
      "or not,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle\n",
      "marked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of\n",
      "cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered\n",
      "toast), she very soon finished it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like a\n",
      "telescope!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
      "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the\n",
      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
      "sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, there's no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather\n",
      "sharply. \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" She generally gave\n",
      "herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and\n",

      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT\n",
      "ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I'll eat it,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which\n",
      "way?\" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was\n",
      "growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",

      "my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings\n",

      "\n",
      "Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in\n",
      "fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took\n",
      "up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\n",
      "look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\n",
      "hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.\n",
      "\n",

      "Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in\n",
      "one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a\n",

      "\n",
      "When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If\n",
      "you please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the\n",

      "And yesterday things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got\n",
      "up this morning? But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in\n",
      "the world am I?' Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while\n",
      "she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she thought. \"I must be\n",
      "growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table to measure\n",
      "herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was\n",
      "going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this\n",
      "was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to\n",
      "save herself from shrinking away altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\n",
      "sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. \"And\n",
      "now for the garden!\" And she ran with all speed back to the little door;\n",
      "but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was\n",

      "never!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment,\n",
      "splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that\n",
      "she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?\n",

      "it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice. \"I dare say it's\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" So she began\n",
      "again: \"Où est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in her French\n",
      "lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to\n",
      "quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice\n",
      "hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite\n",
      "forgot you didn't like cats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would\n",
      "_you_ like cats, if you were me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \"don't be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd\n",
      "take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear,\n",
      "quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it\n",
      "must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd\n",
      "rather not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its\n",
      "tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_\n",
      "cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice\n",
      "little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the\n",
      "rats and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've\n",
      "offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as\n",
      "it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face\n",
      "was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to\n",
      "the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it\n",
      "is I hate cats and dogs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo,\n",
      "a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\n",
      "way and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a\n",
      "consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural\n",
      "to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\n",
      "known them all her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among\n",
      "them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon\n",
      "make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with\n",
      "the Mouse in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with an important air. \"Are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",
      "accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of\n",
      "Mercia and Northumbria'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ugh!\" said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",

      "\"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it\n",
      "advisable'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Found _what_?\" said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Found _it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know\n",
      "what 'it' means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said the\n",
      "Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",
      "archbishop find?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"'--found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\n",
      "crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to\n",
      "Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn't seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that\n",
      "the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that\n",
      "the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it\n",
      "marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party\n",
      "were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two,\n",
      "three and away!\" but they began running when they liked and left off\n",
      "when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.\n",
      "However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite\n",
      "dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \"The race is over!\" and they\n",
      "all crowded 'round it, panting and asking, \"But who has won?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought.\n",
      "At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\n",
      "finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in\n",
      "a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her\n",
      "pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not\n",
      "got into it) and handed them 'round as prizes. There was exactly one\n",
      "a-piece, all 'round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why\n",
      "it is you hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder\n",
      "at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on\n",
      "puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\n",
      "tale was something like this:--\n",

      "you thinking of?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it. And the\n",
      "others all joined in chorus, \"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook\n",
      "its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This caused a\n",
      "remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at\n",
      "once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children,\n",
      "\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various\n",
      "pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and\n",
      "I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry\n",
      "again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while,\n",
      "however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance\n",
      "and she looked up eagerly.\n",

      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it\n",
      "muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my\n",
      "fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves\n",
      "and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\n",
      "nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\n",
      "the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\n",
      "had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone,\n",
      "\"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment and\n",
      "fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He took me for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How\n",
      "surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name \"W. RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a\n",
      "table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny\n",
      "white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was\n",
      "just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle\n",
      "that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her\n",
      "lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for,\n",
      "really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\n",
      "against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\n",
      "broken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite\n",
      "enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and\n",
      "very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing,\n",
      "and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot\n",
      "up the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever\n",
      "happens. What _will_ become of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect\n",
      "and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside\n",
      "and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\"\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\n",
      "as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as\n",
      "the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll\n",
      "go 'round and get in at the window.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame or something of that sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honor!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in\n",
      "the window?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another\n",
      "snatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more\n",
      "sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll do next!\" thought Alice.\n",
      "\"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other ladder?\n",
      "Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to go\n",
      "down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master\n",
      "says you've got to go down the chimney!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till\n",
      "she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney\n",
      "close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what\n",
      "would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\"\n",
      "then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch him, you by the hedge!\" Then\n",
      "silence and then another confusion of voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy\n",
      "now--Don't choke him--What happened to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No\n",
      "more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice noticed, with some\n",
      "surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they\n",
      "lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I eat one of\n",
      "these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in my size.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the\n",
      "moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found\n",
      "herself safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into\n",
      "Alice's.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I\n",

      "'What?'\"\n",

      "Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but\n",
      "she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or\n",
      "drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near\n",
      "her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on\n",
      "tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a\n",
      "large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms\n",

      "least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must\n",
      "have changed several times since then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain\n",
      "yourself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm\n",
      "not myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very\n",
      "confusing.\" She drew herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you\n",
      "ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed\n",
      "to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n",

      "\"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I've something important\n",
      "to say!\" Alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,\n",
      "\"So you think you're changed, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I can't remember things as I\n",
      "used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one\n",
      "doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_\n",
      "larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a\n",
      "wretched height to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing\n",
      "itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and\n",
      "crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side\n",
      "will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow\n",
      "shorter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\n",
      "aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\n",
      "to make out which were the two sides of it. At last she stretched her\n",
      "arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge\n",
      "with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent\n",
      "blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was\n",
      "shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other\n",
      "bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was\n",
      "hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to\n",
      "swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, my head's free at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when\n",
      "she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise\n",
      "like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I\n",
      "can't see you?\" She was delighted to find that her neck would bend\n",
      "about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in\n",
      "curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among\n",
      "the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large\n",
      "pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its\n",
      "wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\n",
      "hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those serpents! There's no pleasing\n",
      "them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon,\n",
      "\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as\n",
      "I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising\n",
      "its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of\n",
      "them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh,\n",
      "Serpent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a\n",
      "little girl,\" she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number\n",
      "of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" said the Pigeon;\n",
      "\"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\n",
      "serpent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not\n",
      "looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want\n",
      "_yours_--I don't like them raw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After awhile she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first. \"The next thing is to get into that\n",
      "beautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this,\n",
      "she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about\n",
      "four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to\n",
      "come upon them _this_ size; why, I should frighten them out of their\n",
      "wits!\" She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought\n",
      "herself down to nine inches high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a\n",
      "footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face\n",
      "only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door\n",
      "with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a\n",
      "round face and large eyes like a frog.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \"For the\n",
      "Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The\n",
      "Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An\n",
      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low\n",
      "and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was\n",
      "sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are;\n",
      "secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first\n",
      "question, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large\n",
      "kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess\n",
      "was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the\n",
      "cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to\n",
      "be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" Alice said to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the\n",
      "kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was\n",
      "grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why your cat\n",
      "grins like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know\n",
      "that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once\n",
      "set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the\n",
      "baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\n",
      "plates and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they\n",
      "hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite\n",
      "impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\n",
      "flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\n",
      "croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I\n",
      "don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to\n",
      "kill it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She\n",
      "said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have\n",
      "nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do with\n",
      "this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted again so violently\n",
      "that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there\n",
      "could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig;\n",
      "so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it\n",
      "trot away quietly into the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a\n",
      "bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her.\n",
      "\"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \"would you please tell me\n",
      "which way I ought to go from here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In _that_ direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives\n",
      "a Hatter; and in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March\n",
      "Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're all mad here. Do you\n",
      "play croquet with the Queen to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited\n",
      "yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\n",
      "the March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near\n",
      "till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it. \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice\n",
      "coming. \"There's _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat\n",
      "down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said\n",
      "was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she\n",
      "added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said the\n",
      "March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least--at least I mean what I\n",
      "say--that's the same thing, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be\n",
      "talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing\n",
      "as 'I sleep when I breathe!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a\n",
      "little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently\n",
      "and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I\n",
      "was going to remark myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied. \"What's the answer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in asking riddles that have no\n",
      "answers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't\n",
      "take more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to\n",
      "take _more_ than nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this, Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly\n",
      "and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were\n",
      "trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, as she picked\n",
      "her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\n",
      "all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees\n",
      "had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \"I\n",
      "think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little\n",
      "glass table. Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that\n",
      "led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\n",
      "had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high;\n",
      "then she walked down the little passage; and _then_--she found herself\n",
      "at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the\n",
      "cool fountains.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses\n",
      "growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\n",
      "painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as\n",
      "she stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a\n",
      "little timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low\n",
      "voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n",
      "_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the Queen\n",
      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\n",
      "you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--\" At this\n",
      "moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps\n",
      "and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them,\n",
      "all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and\n",
      "Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then followed\n",
      "the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet\n",
      "cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE\n",
      "\n",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\n",
      "at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\n",
      "Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\n",
      "but she added to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\n",
      "all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you play croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently\n",
      "meant for Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's--it's a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very,\" said Alice. \"Where's the Duchess?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under sentence of execution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What for?\" said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She boxed the Queen's ears--\" the Rabbit began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her\n",
      "life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live\n",
      "hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double\n",
      "themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time,\n",

      "on. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged\n",
      "in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent\n",
      "opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only\n",
      "difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of\n",
      "the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way,\n",
      "to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under\n",
      "her arm, that it might not escape again.\n",
      "\n",

      "you forget to talk.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Children! Your mother is here and has brought something back with her\n",
      "for each of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the\n",
      "children saw them, and cried, “We will not open the door, our mother\n",
      "has not black feet like you. You are the Wolf!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Wolf ran to a baker, and said, “I have hurt my feet, rub some\n",
      "dough over them for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and\n",
      "said, “Strew some white meal over my feet for me.” The miller thought\n",
      "to himself, “The Wolf wants to deceive some one,” and refused. But the\n",
      "Wolf said, “If you will not do it, I will devour you.” Then the miller\n",
      "was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Yes! so are men!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\n",
      "it, and said, “Open the door for me, Children! Your dear little mother\n",
      "has come home, and has brought every one of you something from the\n",
      "forest with her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little Kids cried, “First show us your paws that we may know if you\n",
      "are our dear little mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he put his paws in through the window. And when the Kids saw that\n",
      "they were white, they believed all that he said, and opened the door.\n",
      "But who should come in but _the Wolf_!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the\n",
      "table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth\n",
      "into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the\n",
      "washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the Wolf found\n",
      "them all and made no delay, but swallowed one after the other down his\n",
      "throat. The youngest in the clock-case was the only one he did not find.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he took himself off, laid\n",
      "himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to\n",
      "sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterward, the old Goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what\n",
      "a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table,\n",
      "chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to\n",
      "pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called\n",
      "them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she\n",
      "called the youngest, a soft voice cried, “Dear Mother, I am in the\n",
      "clock-case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She took the Kid out, and it told her that the Wolf had come and had\n",
      "eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor\n",
      "children!\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, in her grief she went out, and the youngest Kid ran with\n",
      "her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the Wolf by the tree and\n",
      "he was snoring so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on\n",
      "every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his\n",
      "stomach. “Ah!” said she, “is it possible that my poor children, whom he\n",
      "has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and\n",
      "thread, and the Goat cut open the monster’s stomach. Hardly had she\n",
      "made one cut, than a little Kid thrust its head out, and when she had\n",
      "cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still\n",
      "alive, and had suffered no hurt whatever, for in his greediness the\n",
      "monster had swallowed them whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped\n",
      "like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said, “Now go and\n",
      "look for some big stones. We will fill the wicked beast’s stomach with\n",
      "them, while he is asleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the seven Kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put\n",
      "as many of them into his stomach as they could get in. And the mother\n",
      "sewed him up again in the greatest haste; so that he was not aware of\n",
      "anything and never once stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Wolf had had his sleep out, he got on his legs, and as the\n",
      "stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well\n",
      "to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in\n",
      "his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_What rumbles and tumbles\n",
      "      Against my poor bones?\n",
      "      I thought ’twas six Kids,\n",
      "      But it’s only big stones!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he got to the well and stooped over the water and was just\n",
      "about to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in. There was no help\n",
      "for it, but he had to drown miserably!\n",
      "\n",
      "When the seven Kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried\n",
      "aloud, “The Wolf is dead! The Wolf is dead!” and danced for joy round\n",
      "about the well with their mother.\n",

      "\n",
      "These people had a little window at the back of their house from which\n",
      "a splendid garden could be seen. It was full of the most beautiful\n",
      "flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\n",
      "one dared to go into it because it belonged to a Witch, who had great\n",
      "power and was dreaded by all the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the woman was standing by this window and looking down\n",
      "into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most\n",
      "beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she\n",
      "longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.\n",
      "\n",
      "This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah,” she replied, “if I can’t get some of the rampion to eat, which is\n",
      "in the garden behind our house, I shall die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, who loved her, thought, “Sooner than let your wife die, bring\n",

      "\n",
      "In the twilight of evening, he clambered over the wall into the garden\n",
      "of the Witch, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to\n",
      "his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it with much\n",
      "relish.\n",
      "\n",
      "She, however, liked it so much--so very much--that the next day she\n",
      "longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any\n",

      "of evening, therefore, he let himself down again. But when he had\n",
      "clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the Witch\n",
      "standing before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dare you,” said she with angry look, “descend into my garden and\n",
      "steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” answered he, “let mercy take the place of justice! I had to do it\n",
      "out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt\n",
      "such a longing for it that she would have died, if she had not got some\n",
      "to eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Witch let her anger be softened, and said to him, “If the case\n",
      "be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion\n",
      "as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child\n",

      "The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman at\n",

      "\n",
      "Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun. When she\n",
      "was twelve years old, the Witch shut her into a tower, which lay in\n",
      "a forest, and had neither stairs nor door. But quite at the top was\n",
      "a little window. When the Witch wanted to go in, she placed herself\n",
      "beneath this, and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n",
      "      Let down thy hair._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\n",

      "wound them round one of the hooks of the window above. And then the\n",
      "hair fell twenty ells down, and the Witch climbed up by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year or two, it came to pass that the King’s Son rode through\n",
      "the forest and went by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\n",
      "charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in\n",
      "her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of\n",
      "the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had\n",
      "so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest\n",
      "and listened to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that a Witch came\n",
      "there, and he heard how she cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n",
      "      Let down thy hair._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the Witch climbed up\n",
      "to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my\n",
      "fortune,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:\n",

      "    “_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n",
      "      Let down thy hair._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately the hair fell down, and the King’s Son climbed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\n",
      "had never yet beheld, came to her. But the King’s Son began to talk\n",
      "to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so\n",
      "stirred, that it had let him have no rest, so he had been forced to see\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\n",
      "him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\n",
      "thought, “He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does;” and she said\n",
      "yes, and laid her hand in his.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said also, “I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know\n",
      "how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you\n",
      "come, and I will weave a ladder with it. When that is ready I will\n",
      "descend, and you will take me on your horse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They agreed that until that time, he should come to her every evening,\n",
      "for the old woman came by day. The Witch remarked nothing of this,\n",
      "until once Rapunzel said to her, “Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens\n",
      "that you are so much heavier for me to draw up, than the young King’s\n",
      "Son--he is with me in a moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you wicked Child!” cried the Witch. “What do I hear you say!\n",
      "I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have\n",
      "deceived me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them\n",
      "twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right,\n",
      "and _snip, snap,_ they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the\n",
      "ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a\n",
      "desert, where she had to live in great grief and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the Witch, in the\n",
      "evening, fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off, to the hook\n",
      "of the window; and when the King’s Son came and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n",
      "      Let down thy hair,_”\n",
      "\n",
      "she let the hair down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son ascended. He did not find his dearest Rapunzel above,\n",
      "but the Witch, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha!” she cried mockingly, “you would fetch your dearest! But the\n",
      "beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest. The cat has got it,\n",
      "and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you! You\n",
      "will never see her more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son was beside himself with grief and in his despair he\n",
      "leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns\n",
      "into which he fell, pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind\n",
      "about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing\n",
      "but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to\n",
      "the desert where Rapunzel lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice,\n",
      "and it seemed so familiar to him that he went toward it. When he\n",
      "approached, Rapunzel knew him, and fell on his neck and wept. Two of\n",
      "her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see\n",
      "with them as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He led her to his Kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they\n",
      "lived for a long time, happy and contented.\n",

      "Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said, “Since our\n",

      "day, and if we come near her, she kicks us away with her foot. Our\n",
      "meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over. The little dog\n",
      "under the table is better off, for she often throws it a nice bit.\n",
      "May Heaven pity us! If our mother only knew! Come, we will go forth\n",
      "together into the wide world.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with\n",

      "\n",
      "But the wicked stepmother was a Witch, and had seen how the two\n",
      "children had gone away. She had crept after them, as Witches do creep,\n",
      "and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the stones,\n",
      "the little brother was going to drink out of it, but the little sister\n",
      "heard how it said as it ran:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Who drinks of me, a Tiger be!\n",

      "thirst is too great.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they came to the third brook, the little sister heard how it\n",

      "The little sister said, “Oh, I pray you, dear little Brother, do not\n",
      "drink, or you will become a Roe, and run away from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little brother had knelt by the brook, and had bent down and\n",
      "drunk some of the water. And as soon as the first drops touched his\n",
      "lips, he lay there a young Roe.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the little sister wept over her poor bewitched little brother,\n",

      "\n",
      "Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the Roe’s neck, and\n",
      "she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord. With this she tied\n",
      "the little animal and led it on; and she walked deeper and deeper into\n",
      "the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they had gone a very long way, they came to a little house.\n",
      "The girl looked in; and as it was empty, she thought, “We can stay here\n",

      "\n",
      "Then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the Roe.\n",
      "Every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for\n",
      "herself, and brought tender grass for the Roe, who ate out of her hand,\n",
      "and was content and played round about her. In the evening, when the\n",
      "little sister was tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head\n",
      "upon the Roe’s back: that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it.\n",
      "And if only the little brother had had his human form, it would have\n",
      "been a delightful life.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time, they were alone like this in the wilderness. But it\n",

      "Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs, and the merry shouts\n",
      "of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the Roe heard all, and was\n",
      "only too anxious to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said he to his little sister, “let me be off to the hunt, I\n",
      "cannot bear it any longer;” and he begged so much that at last she\n",
      "agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But,” said she to him, “come back to me in the evening. I must shut\n",
      "my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, ‘My little\n",
      "Sister, let me in!’ that I may know you. And if you do not say that, I\n",
      "shall not open the door.”\n",
      "\n",

      "open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King and the huntsmen saw the pretty creature, and started after\n",
      "him. But they could not catch him, and when they thought that they\n",
      "surely had him, away he sprang through the bushes and was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark he ran to the cottage, knocked, and said, “My little\n",
      "Sister, let me in.” Then the door was opened for him, and he jumped in,\n",
      "and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, the hunt went on afresh, and when the Roe again heard the\n",
      "bugle-horn, and the _ho! ho!_ of the huntsmen, he had no peace, but\n",
      "said, “Sister, let me out, I must be off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister opened the door for him, and said, “But you must be here\n",
      "again in the evening and say your password.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King and his huntsmen again saw the young Roe with the golden\n",
      "collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick and nimble for\n",
      "them. This went on for the whole day, but by evening the huntsmen had\n",
      "surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so\n",
      "that he limped and ran slowly. Then a hunter crept after him to the\n",
      "cottage and heard how he said, “My little Sister, let me in,” and saw\n",
      "that the door was opened for him, and was shut again at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman took notice of it all, and went to the King and told him\n",
      "what he had seen and heard. Then the King said, “To-morrow we will hunt\n",
      "once more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that\n",
      "her little Roe was hurt. She washed the blood off him, laid herbs on\n",
      "the wound, and said, “Go to your bed, dear Roe, that you may get well\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wound was so slight that the Roe, next morning, did not feel it\n",
      "any more. And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, “I cannot\n",
      "bear it, I must be there. They shall not find it so easy to catch me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little sister cried, and said, “This time they will kill you, and\n",
      "here am I alone in the forest, and forsaken by all the world. I will\n",
      "not let you out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you will have me die of grief,” answered the Roe. “When I hear\n",
      "the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the little sister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for\n",
      "him with a heavy heart, and the Roe, full of health and joy, bounded\n",
      "away into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King saw him, he said to his huntsman, “Now chase him all day\n",
      "long till nightfall, but take care that no one does him any harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the sun had set, the King said to the huntsmen, “Now come\n",
      "and show me the cottage in the wood;” and when he was at the door,\n",
      "he knocked and called out, “Dear little Sister, let me in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the door opened, and the King walked in, and there stood a maiden\n",
      "more lovely than any he had ever seen. The maiden was frightened when\n",
      "she saw, not her little Roe, but a man with a golden crown upon his\n",
      "head. But the King looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” answered the maiden, “but the little Roe must go with\n",
      "me. I cannot leave him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said, “He shall stay with you as long as you live, and shall\n",
      "want nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then he came running in, and the little sister again tied him with\n",
      "the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and went away with the\n",
      "King from the cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his\n",
      "palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp. She was now the\n",
      "Queen, and they lived for a long time happily together. The Roe was\n",
      "tended and cherished, and ran about in the palace-garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wicked Witch, because of whom the children had gone out into\n",
      "the world, thought all the time that the little sister had been torn to\n",
      "pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the little brother had\n",
      "been shot for a Roe by the huntsmen. Now when she heard that they were\n",
      "so happy, and so well off, envy and hatred rose in her heart and left\n",
      "her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them\n",
      "again to misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own daughter, who was as ugly as night, and had only one eye,\n",
      "grumbled at her and said, “A Queen! that ought to have been my luck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only be quiet,” answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying,\n",
      "“when the time comes I shall be ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As time went on, the Queen had a pretty little boy. It happened that\n",
      "the King was out hunting; so the old Witch took the form of the\n",
      "chambermaid, went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her,\n",
      "“Come, the bath is ready. It will do you good, and give you fresh\n",
      "strength. Make haste before it gets cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The daughter also was close by; so they carried the weak Queen into the\n",
      "bathroom, and put her into the bath. Then they shut the door and ran\n",
      "away. But in the bathroom they had made a fire of such deadly heat,\n",
      "that the beautiful young Queen was soon suffocated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this was done, the old woman took her daughter, put a nightcap on\n",
      "her head, and laid her in bed in place of the Queen. She gave her too\n",
      "the shape and the look of the Queen, only she could not make good the\n",
      "lost eye. But, in order that the King might not see it, she was to lie\n",
      "on the side on which she had no eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when he came home and heard that he had a son, he was\n",
      "heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she\n",
      "was. But the old woman quickly called out, “For your life leave the\n",
      "curtains closed. The Queen ought not to see the light yet, and must\n",
      "have rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King went away, and did not find out that a false Queen was lying\n",
      "in the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the\n",
      "nursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw the door\n",
      "open and the true Queen walk in. She took the child out of the cradle,\n",
      "laid it on her arm and nursed it. Then she shook up its pillow, laid\n",
      "the child down again, and covered it with the little quilt. And she did\n",
      "not forget the Roe, but went into the corner where he lay, and stroked\n",
      "his back. Then she went quite silently out of the door again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the nurse asked the guards whether any one had come\n",
      "into the palace during the night, but they answered, “No, we have seen\n",
      "no one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She came thus many nights and never spoke a word. The nurse always saw\n",
      "her, but she did not dare to tell any one about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When some time had passed in this manner, the Queen began to speak in\n",
      "the night, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_How fares my child, how fares my Roe?\n",
      "      Twice shall I come, then never moe!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "The nurse did not answer, but when the Queen had gone again, went to\n",
      "the King and told him all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said, “Ah, heavens! what is this? To-morrow night I will watch\n",
      "by the child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen\n",
      "again appeared, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_How fares my child, how fares my Roe?\n",
      "      Once shall I come, then never moe!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.\n",
      "The King dared not speak to her, but on the next night he watched\n",
      "again. Then she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_How fares my child, How fares my Roe?\n",
      "      This time I come, then never moe!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that the King could not restrain himself. He sprang toward her, and\n",
      "said, “You can be none other than my dear wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered, “Yes, I am your dear wife,” and at the same moment she\n",
      "received life again, and by God’s grace became fresh, rosy, and full of\n",
      "health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told the King the evil deed which the wicked Witch and her\n",
      "daughter had been guilty of toward her. The King ordered both to be led\n",
      "before the judge, and judgment was delivered against them. The daughter\n",
      "was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts,\n",
      "but the Witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as soon as she was burnt the Roe changed his shape, and received\n",
      "his human form again. So the little sister and little brother lived\n",
      "happily together all their lives.\n",

      "There was once on a time, a little girl whose father and mother were\n",
      "dead. She was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live\n",
      "in, or bed to sleep in. At last, she had nothing else but the clothes\n",
      "she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some\n",
      "charitable soul had given her. She was, however, good and pious.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the\n",
      "open country, trusting in the good God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a poor man met her, who said, “Ah, give me something to eat, I am\n",
      "so hungry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, “May God\n",

      "\n",
      "Then came a child who moaned and said, “My head is so cold, give me\n",

      "\n",
      "So she took off her hood and gave it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had\n",
      "no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and\n",
      "there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt. The good\n",
      "little girl thought to herself, “It is a dark night and no one sees me.\n",
      "I can very well give my little shirt away,” and took it off, and gave\n",
      "away that also.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she so stood, and had not one single thing left. Then suddenly some\n",
      "Stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth\n",
      "pieces of money! And although she had just given her little shirt away,\n",
      "lo! she had a new one which was of the very finest linen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the\n",

      "There was once on a time, a Fisherman who lived with his wife in a\n",

      "And once, as he was sitting with his rod, looking at the clear water,\n",
      "his line suddenly went down, far down below, and when he drew it up\n",
      "again, he brought out a large Flounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Flounder said to him: “Hark, you Fisherman, I pray you, let me\n",
      "live. I am no Flounder really, but an enchanted Prince. What good will\n",
      "it do you to kill me? I should not be good to eat. Put me in the water\n",
      "again, and let me go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said the Fisherman, “there is no need for so many words about\n",
      "it--a fish that can talk I should certainly let go, anyhow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he put him back again into the clear water, and the Flounder\n",
      "went to the bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him. Then the\n",
      "Fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the hovel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said the woman, “have you caught nothing to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the man, “I did catch a Flounder, who said he was an\n",
      "enchanted Prince, so I let him go again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you not wish for anything first?” said the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the man; “what should I wish for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said the woman, “it is surely hard to have to live always in\n",
      "this dirty hovel. You might have wished for a small cottage for us. Go\n",
      "back and call him. Tell him we want to have a small cottage. He will\n",
      "certainly give us that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said the man, “why should I go there again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the woman, “you did catch him, and you let him go again. He\n",
      "is sure to do it. Go at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man still did not quite like to go, but did not want to oppose his\n",
      "wife, and went to the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no longer\n",
      "smooth. So he stood and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,\n",
      "      Come, I pray thee, here to me;\n",
      "      For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,\n",
      "      Wills not as I’d have her will._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Flounder came swimming to him and said, “Well, what does she\n",
      "want, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said the man, “I did catch you, and my wife says I really ought\n",
      "to have wished for something. She does not like to live in a wretched\n",
      "hovel any longer. She would like to have a cottage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go, then,” said the Flounder, “she has it already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the man got home, his wife was no longer in the hovel. But instead\n",
      "of it, there stood a small cottage, and she was sitting on a bench\n",
      "before the door. Then she took him by the hand and said to him, “Just\n",
      "come inside, look. Now isn’t this a great deal better?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a pretty little\n",
      "parlor and bedroom, and a kitchen and pantry, with the best of\n",
      "furniture, and fitted up with the most beautiful things made of tin and\n",
      "brass, whatsoever was wanted. And behind the cottage, there was a small\n",
      "yard, with hens and ducks, and a little garden with flowers and fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look,” said the wife, “is not that nice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the husband, “and so we must always think it,--now we will\n",
      "live quite contented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will think about that,” said the wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that they ate something and went to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the woman\n",
      "said, “Hark you, Husband, this cottage is far too small for us, and the\n",
      "garden and yard are little. The Flounder might just as well have given\n",
      "us a larger house. I should like to live in a great stone castle. Go to\n",
      "the Flounder, and tell him to give us a castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Wife,” said the man, “the cottage is quite good enough. Why should\n",
      "we live in a castle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said the woman; “go at once, the Flounder can always do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Wife,” said the man, “the Flounder has just given us the cottage.\n",
      "I do not like to go back so soon, it might make him angry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go,” said the woman, “he can do it quite easily, and will be glad to\n",
      "do it. Just you go to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man’s heart grew heavy, and he did not wish to go. He said to\n",
      "himself, “It is not right,” and yet he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he came to the sea, the water was quite purple and dark-blue,\n",
      "and gray and thick, and no longer green and yellow, but it was still\n",
      "quiet. And he stood there and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,\n",
      "      Come, I pray thee, here to me;\n",
      "      For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,\n",
      "      Wills not as I’d have her will._”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas,” said the man, half scared, “she wants to live in a great stone\n",
      "castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to it, then, she is standing before the door,” said the Flounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the man went home, and when he got there, he found a great stone\n",
      "palace, and his wife was just standing on the steps going in. She took\n",
      "him by the hand and said, “Come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went with her, and in the castle was a great hall paved with\n",
      "marble, and many servants, who flung wide the doors. The walls were all\n",
      "bright with beautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables\n",
      "of pure gold. Crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and all the\n",
      "rooms and bedrooms had carpets. Food and wine of the very best were\n",
      "standing on all the tables, so that they nearly broke down beneath it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the house, too, there was a great courtyard, with stables\n",
      "for horses and cows, and the very best of carriages. There was a\n",
      "magnificent large garden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and\n",
      "fruit-trees, and a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags,\n",
      "deer, and hares, and everything that could be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said the woman, “isn’t that beautiful?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” said the man, “now let it be; and we will live in this\n",
      "beautiful castle and be content.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will consider about that,” said the woman, “and sleep upon it;”\n",
      "thereupon they went to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, the wife awoke first. It was just daybreak, and from her\n",
      "bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her. Her husband was\n",
      "still stretching himself, so she poked him in the side with her elbow,\n",
      "and said, “Get up, Husband, and just peep out of the window. Look you,\n",
      "couldn’t we be the King over all that land? Go to the Flounder, we will\n",
      "be the King.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Wife,” said the man, “why should we be King? I do not want to be\n",
      "King.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the wife, “if you won’t be King, I will. Go to the\n",
      "Flounder, for I will be King.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Wife,” said the man, “why do you want to be King? I do not like to\n",
      "say that to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” said the woman; “go to him at once. I must be King!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the man went, and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be\n",
      "King. “It is not right; it is not right,” thought he. He did not wish\n",
      "to go, but yet he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-gray, and the water\n",
      "heaved up from below, and smelt putrid. Then he went and stood by it,\n",
      "and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,\n",
      "      Come, I pray thee, here to me;\n",

      "      Wills not as I’d have her will._”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.\n",

      "soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets. And when he went inside the\n",
      "house, everything was of real marble and gold, with velvet covers and\n",
      "great golden tassels. Then the doors of the hall were opened, and there\n",
      "was the Court in all its splendor, and his wife was sitting on a high\n",
      "throne of gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head,\n",
      "and a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand. On both sides of\n",
      "her, stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each of them always one head\n",
      "shorter than the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went and stood before her, and said, “Ah, Wife, and now you are\n",
      "King.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the woman, “now I am King.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus for\n",
      "some time, he said, “And now that you are King, let all else be, we\n",
      "will wish for nothing more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, Husband,” said the woman, quite anxiously, “I find time pass\n",
      "very heavily, I can bear it no longer. Go to the Flounder--I am King,\n",
      "but I must be Emperor, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, Wife, why do you wish to be Emperor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said she, “go to the Flounder. I will be Emperor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, Wife,” said the man, “he cannot make you Emperor. I may not say\n",
      "that to the fish. There is only one Emperor in the land. An Emperor,\n",
      "the Flounder cannot make you! I assure you he cannot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said the woman, “I am the King, and you are nothing but my\n",
      "husband. Will you go this moment? go at once! If he can make a King, he\n",
      "can make an Emperor. I will be Emperor. Go instantly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he was forced to go. As the man went, however, he was troubled in\n",
      "mind, and thought to himself, “It will not end well! It will not end\n",
      "well! Emperor is too shameless! The Flounder will at last be tired out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and thick,\n",
      "and began to boil up from below, so that it threw up bubbles. And such\n",
      "a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled, and the man was afraid. Then\n",
      "he went and stood by it, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,\n",
      "      Come, I pray thee, here to me;\n",
      "      For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,\n",
      "      Wills not as I’d have her will._”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, Flounder,” said he, “my wife wants to be Emperor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to her,” said the Flounder; “she is Emperor already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made of\n",
      "polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments. And\n",
      "soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets, and beating\n",
      "cymbals and drums. In the house, barons, and counts, and dukes were\n",
      "going about as servants. Then they opened the doors to him, which were\n",
      "of pure gold. And when he entered, there sat his wife on a throne,\n",
      "which was made of one piece of gold, and was quite two miles high;\n",
      "and she wore a great golden crown that was three yards high, and set\n",
      "with diamonds and carbuncles. In one hand she had the sceptre, and in\n",
      "the other the imperial orb. And on both sides of her stood the yeomen\n",
      "of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one before him,\n",
      "from the biggest Giant, who was two miles high, to the very smallest\n",
      "Dwarf, just as big as my little finger. And before it stood a number of\n",
      "princes and dukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the man went and stood among than, and said, “Wife, are you\n",
      "Emperor now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said she, “now I am Emperor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he stood and looked at her well, and when he had looked at her\n",
      "thus for some time, he said, “Ah, Wife, be content, now that you are\n",
      "Emperor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said she, “why are you standing there? Now, I am Emperor,\n",
      "but I will be Pope too. Go to the Flounder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, Wife,” said the man, “what will you not wish for? You cannot be\n",
      "Pope. There is but one in Christendom. He cannot make you Pope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said she, “I will be Pope. Go immediately. I must be Pope\n",
      "this very day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Wife,” said the man, “I do not like to say that to him; that would\n",
      "not do, it is too much. The Flounder can’t make you Pope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said she, “what nonsense! if he can make an Emperor he can\n",
      "make a Pope. Go to him directly. I am Emperor, and you are nothing but\n",
      "my husband. Will you go at once?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he was afraid and went. But he was quite faint, and shivered and\n",
      "shook, and his knees and legs trembled. And a high wind blew over the\n",
      "land, and the clouds flew, and toward evening all grew dark, and the\n",
      "leaves fell from the trees, and the water rose and roared as if it were\n",
      "boiling, and splashed upon the shore. In the distance he saw ships\n",
      "which were firing guns in their sore need, pitching and tossing on the\n",
      "waves. And yet in the midst of the sky, there was still a small bit of\n",
      "blue, though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm. So, full\n",
      "of despair, he went and stood in much fear, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,\n",
      "      Come, I pray thee, here to me;\n",
      "      For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,\n",
      "      Wills not as I’d have her will._”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas,” said the man, “she wants to be Pope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to her then,” said the Flounder; “she is Pope already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So he went, and when he got there, he saw what seemed to be a large\n",
      "church surrounded by palaces. He pushed his way through the crowd.\n",
      "Inside, however, everything was lighted with thousands and thousands of\n",
      "candles, and his wife was clad in gold, and she was sitting on a much\n",
      "higher throne, and had three great golden crowns on, and round about\n",
      "her there was much churchly splendor. And on both sides of her was a\n",
      "row of candles, the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest\n",
      "tower, down to the very smallest kitchen candle; and all the emperors\n",
      "and kings were on their knees before her, kissing her shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wife,” said the man, and looked attentively at her, “are you now Pope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said she, “I am Pope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he stood and looked at her, and it was just as if he was looking at\n",
      "the bright sun. When he had stood looking at her thus for a short time,\n",
      "he said, “Ah, Wife, if you are Pope, do let well alone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she looked as stiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs\n",
      "of life. Then said he, “Wife, now that you are Pope, be satisfied, you\n",
      "cannot become anything greater.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will consider about that,” said the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon they both went to bed. But she was not satisfied, and\n",
      "greediness let her have no sleep, for she was continually thinking what\n",
      "there was left for her to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a great deal\n",
      "during the day. But the woman could not fall asleep at all, and flung\n",
      "herself from one side to the other the whole night through, thinking\n",
      "what more was left for her to be, but unable to call to mind anything\n",
      "else.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the sun began to rise, and when the woman saw the red of\n",
      "dawn, she sat up in bed and looked at it. And when, through the window,\n",
      "she saw the sun thus rising, she said, “Cannot I, too, order the sun\n",
      "and moon to rise?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said she, poking him in the ribs with her elbows, “wake up!\n",
      "go to the Flounder, for I wish to be even as God is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was still half asleep, but he was so horrified that he fell out\n",
      "of bed. He thought he must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and\n",
      "said, “Alas, Wife, what are you saying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Husband,” said she, “if I can’t order the sun and moon to rise, and\n",
      "have to look on and see the sun and moon rising, I can’t bear it. I\n",
      "shall not know what it is to have another happy hour, unless I can make\n",
      "them rise myself.” Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder\n",
      "ran over him, and said, “Go at once. I wish to be like unto God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, Wife,” said the man, falling on his knees before her, “the\n",
      "Flounder cannot do that. He can make an Emperor and a Pope. I beseech\n",
      "you, go on as you are, and be Pope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she fell into a rage, and her hair flew wildly about her head, and\n",
      "she cried, “I will not endure this, I’ll not bear it any longer. Will\n",
      "you go?” Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.\n",
      "\n",
      "But outside a great storm was raging, and blowing so hard that he\n",
      "could scarcely keep his feet. Houses and trees toppled over, mountains\n",
      "trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was pitch black, and it\n",
      "thundered and lightened. And the sea came in with black waves as high\n",
      "as church-towers and mountains, and all with crests of white foam at\n",
      "the top. Then he cried, but could not hear his own words:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,\n",
      "      Come, I pray thee, here to me;\n",

      "      Wills not as I’d have her will._”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well; what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas,” said he, “she wants to be like unto God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to her, and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And there they are living at this very time.\n",

      "A long time ago, there lived a King who was famed for his wisdom\n",
      "through all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if\n",
      "news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had a strange custom. Every day after dinner, when the table was\n",
      "cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him\n",
      "one more dish. It was covered and even the servant did not know what\n",
      "was in it. Neither did any one know, for the King never took off the\n",
      "cover to eat of it, until he was quite alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\n",
      "away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\n",
      "carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\n",
      "he lifted up the cover, and saw a White Snake lying on the dish. But\n",
      "when he saw it, he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\n",
      "so he cut off a little bit and put it into his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering\n",
      "of little voices outside his window. He went and listened, and then\n",
      "noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and\n",
      "telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the\n",
      "fields and woods. Eating the Snake had given him power to understand\n",
      "the language of animals!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it so happened, that on this very day the Queen lost her most\n",
      "beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\n",
      "servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The King ordered the man to\n",
      "be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\n",
      "could, before the morrow, point out the thief, he himself should be\n",
      "looked upon as guilty and should be executed. In vain, he declared his\n",
      "innocence. He was dismissed with no better answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his trouble and fear, he went down into the courtyard, and took\n",
      "thought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were\n",
      "sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest. And, whilst\n",
      "they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were\n",
      "having a confidential conversation. The servant stood by and listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were telling one another of all the places where they had been\n",
      "waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found. And\n",
      "one said in a pitiful tone, “Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\n",
      "I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the Queen’s\n",
      "window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen,\n",
      "and said to the cook, “Here is a fine duck. Pray kill her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; “she has spared\n",
      "no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting long enough to be\n",
      "roasted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he cut off her head; and as she was being dressed for the spit, the\n",
      "Queen’s ring was found inside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant could now easily prove his innocence. The King, to make\n",
      "amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favor, and promised him the\n",
      "best place in the Court. The servant refused everything, and asked only\n",
      "for a horse and some money for traveling, as he had a mind to see the\n",
      "world and go about a little. When his request was granted, he set out\n",
      "on his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the\n",
      "reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is said that fishes are\n",
      "dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably. As he\n",
      "had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back\n",
      "into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "They quivered with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him, “We\n",
      "will remember you, and repay you for saving us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\n",
      "the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an Ant-King complain, “Why\n",
      "cannot folk, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\n",
      "horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\n",
      "mercy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he turned on to a side path and the Ant-King cried out to him, “We\n",
      "will remember you---one good turn deserves another!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\n",
      "by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. “Out with you, you\n",
      "idle, good-for-nothing creatures!” cried they; “we cannot find food\n",
      "for you any longer. You are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground flapping their wings, and\n",
      "crying, “Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\n",
      "and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his\n",
      "sword, and gave it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it,\n",
      "satisfied their hunger, and cried, “We will remember you--one good turn\n",
      "deserves another!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way,\n",
      "he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the\n",
      "streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud, “The King’s\n",
      "Daughter wants a husband. But whoever sues for her hand must perform a\n",
      "hard task. If he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many had already made the attempt, but in vain. Nevertheless, when the\n",
      "youth saw the King’s Daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty,\n",
      "that he forgot all danger, went before the King, and declared himself a\n",
      "suitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was cast into it. Then\n",
      "the King ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea,\n",
      "and added, “If you come up without it, you will be thrown in again and\n",
      "again until you perish amid the waves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away;\n",
      "leaving him alone by the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\n",
      "he saw three fishes come swimming toward him. They were the very\n",
      "fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\n",
      "its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet. When he had\n",
      "taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full\n",
      "of joy he took it to the King, and expected that he would grant him the\n",
      "promised reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the proud Princess perceived that he was not her equal in\n",
      "birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\n",
      "task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\n",
      "sacksful of millet-seed on the grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said, “To-morrow morning before sunrise these must be picked\n",
      "up, and not a single grain be wanting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth sat down in the garden and considered how he might perform\n",
      "this task. But he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully\n",
      "awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But as soon\n",
      "as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden, he saw all the\n",
      "ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain\n",
      "was missing. The Ant-King had come in the night with thousands and\n",
      "thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had, by great industry,\n",
      "picked up all the millet-seeds and gathered them into the sacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently, the King’s Daughter herself came down into the garden, and\n",
      "was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said, “Although he\n",
      "has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband, until he has\n",
      "brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out,\n",
      "and would have gone on forever, as long as his legs would carry him,\n",
      "though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through\n",
      "three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a\n",
      "tree to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a Golden Apple fell into\n",
      "his hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched\n",
      "themselves upon his knee, and said, “We are the three young ravens whom\n",
      "you saved from starving. When we had grown big, and heard that you were\n",
      "seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world,\n",
      "where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the apple.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth, full of joy, set out homeward, and took the Golden Apple\n",
      "to the King’s beautiful Daughter, who had now no more excuses left to\n",
      "make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then\n",

      "Now, when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in\n",
      "his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, “What is to become of us?\n",
      "How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything\n",
      "even for ourselves?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you what, Husband,” answered the woman, “early to-morrow\n",
      "morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is\n",
      "the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each of\n",
      "them one piece of bread more. Then we will go to our work and leave\n",
      "them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid\n",
      "of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Wife,” said the man, “I will not do that. How can I bear to leave\n",
      "my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would soon come and\n",
      "tear them to pieces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you fool!” said she. “Then we must all four die of hunger. You may\n",
      "as well plane the planks for our coffins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she left him no peace until he consented. “But I feel very sorry\n",
      "for the poor children, all the same,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\n",
      "heard what the woman had said to their father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grethel wept bitter tears, and said to Haensel, “Now all is over with\n",
      "us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be quiet, Grethel,” said Haensel, “do not distress yourself, I will\n",
      "soon find a way to help us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the old folk had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little\n",
      "coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone\n",
      "brightly, and the white pebbles, which lay in front of the house,\n",
      "glittered like real silver pennies. Haensel stooped and put as many of\n",
      "them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went back and said to Grethel, “Be comforted, dear little\n",
      "Sister, and sleep in peace. God will not forsake us,” and he lay down\n",
      "again in his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke\n",
      "the two children, saying, “Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\n",
      "forest to fetch wood.” She gave each a little piece of bread, and said,\n",
      "“There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\n",
      "for you will get nothing else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Grethel took the bread under her apron, as Haensel had the stones in\n",
      "his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.\n",
      "When they had walked a short time, Haensel stood still and peeped\n",
      "back, and did so again and again while he was throwing the white\n",
      "pebble-stones one by one out of his pocket onto the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, “Now,\n",
      "Children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\n",
      "be cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Haensel and Grethel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little\n",
      "hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very\n",
      "high, the woman said, “Now, Children, lay yourselves down by the fire\n",
      "and rest. We will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have\n",
      "done, we will come back and fetch you away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Haensel and Grethel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a\n",
      "little piece of bread; and, as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe,\n",
      "they believed that their father was near. It was, however, not the axe,\n",
      "it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind\n",
      "was blowing backward and forward. And as they had been sitting such a\n",
      "long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Grethel began to cry\n",
      "and said, “How are we to get out of the forest now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Haensel comforted her, and said, “Just wait a little, until the\n",
      "moon has risen, and then we shall soon find the way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the full moon had risen, Haensel took his little sister by the\n",
      "hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver\n",
      "pieces, and showed them the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked the whole night long, and, by break of day, came once more\n",
      "to their father’s house. They knocked at the door; and when the woman\n",
      "opened it and saw that it was Haensel and Grethel, she said, “You\n",
      "naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought\n",
      "you were never coming back at all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave\n",
      "them behind alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long afterward, there was another famine in all parts, and\n",
      "the children heard their mother saying at night to their father,\n",
      "“Everything is eaten again, we have one-half loaf left, and after that\n",
      "there is an end. The children must go, we will take them farther into\n",
      "the wood, so that they will not find their way out again. There is no\n",
      "other means of saving ourselves!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought “it would be better for you\n",
      "to share the last mouthful with your children!” The woman, however,\n",
      "would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached\n",
      "him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the\n",
      "first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation.\n",
      "When the old folk were asleep, Haensel again got up to go out and pick\n",
      "up pebbles. But the woman had locked the door, and Haensel could not\n",
      "get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, “Do not\n",
      "cry, Grethel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning, came the woman, and took the children out of\n",
      "their beds. Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still\n",
      "smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest, Haensel\n",
      "crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on\n",
      "the ground, and little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\n",
      "never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\n",
      "the mother said, “Just sit there, you Children, and when you are tired\n",
      "you may sleep a little. We are going into the forest to cut wood. In\n",
      "the evening, when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was noon, Grethel shared her piece of bread with Haensel,\n",
      "who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep, and evening\n",
      "passed, but no one came to the poor children.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not awake until it was dark night, and Haensel comforted his\n",
      "little sister and said, “Just wait, Grethel, until the moon rises, and\n",
      "then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn. They will\n",
      "show us our way home again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the moon came, they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the\n",
      "many thousands of birds, which fly about in the woods and fields, had\n",
      "picked them all up. Haensel said to Grethel, “We shall soon find the\n",
      "way,” but they did not find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked the whole night and all the next day, from morning till\n",
      "evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry,\n",
      "for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the\n",
      "ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no\n",
      "longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house.\n",
      "They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest.\n",
      "If help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness!\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was midday, they saw a beautiful Snow-White Bird sitting on a\n",
      "bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened\n",
      "to it. And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew\n",
      "away before them. They followed it until they reached a little house,\n",
      "on the roof of which it alighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came quite up to the little House they saw that it was built\n",
      "of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear\n",
      "sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will set to work on that,” said Haensel, “and have a good meal.\n",
      "I will eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grethel, can eat some of the\n",
      "window; it will taste sweet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Haensel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to try how it\n",
      "tasted. Grethel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then\n",
      "a soft voice cried from the room:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Nibble, nibble, gnaw!\n",
      "      Who nibbles at my door?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "but the children went on eating without disturbing themselves. Haensel,\n",
      "who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it.\n",
      "Grethel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and\n",
      "enjoyed herself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, leaning on\n",
      "crutches, came creeping out. Haensel and Grethel were so terribly\n",
      "frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman, however, nodded her head, and said, “Oh, you dear\n",
      "Children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No\n",
      "harm shall happen to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.\n",
      "Then she set good food before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar,\n",
      "apples, and nuts. Afterward she covered two pretty little beds with\n",
      "clean white linen, and Haensel and Grethel lay down in them, and\n",
      "thought they were in Heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman had only pretended to be so kind. She was really a wicked\n",
      "Witch, who lay in wait for children, and who had built the little bread\n",
      "house in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power,\n",
      "she killed it, cooked, and ate it; and that was a feast-day with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen\n",
      "scent like the beasts’, and are aware when human beings draw near.\n",
      "When Haensel and Grethel came into her neighborhood, she laughed\n",
      "maliciously, and said mockingly, “I have them, they shall not escape me\n",
      "again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was up. And\n",
      "when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their\n",
      "plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, “That will be a dainty\n",
      "mouthful!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she seized Haensel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a\n",
      "little stable, and shut him in with a grated door. He might scream as\n",
      "he liked, that was of no use!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she went to Grethel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, “Get up,\n",
      "lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother.\n",
      "He is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I\n",
      "will eat him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Grethel began to weep bitterly. But it was all in vain, she was forced\n",
      "to do what the wicked Witch ordered her.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the best food was cooked for poor Haensel, while Grethel got\n",
      "nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little\n",
      "stable, and cried, “Haensel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if\n",
      "you will soon be fat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When four weeks had gone by she was seized with impatience and would\n",
      "not wait any longer. “Ho, there! Grethel,” she cried to the girl, “be\n",
      "active, and bring some water. Let Haensel be fat or lean, to-morrow I\n",
      "will kill him, and cook him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the\n",
      "water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks! “Dear God, do\n",
      "help us,” she cried. “If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured\n",
      "us, we should at any rate have died together!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just keep your noise to yourself,” said the Old Woman, “all that won’t\n",
      "help you at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning, Grethel had to go out and hang up the cauldron,\n",
      "full of water, and light the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will bake first,” said the Old Woman, “I have already heated the\n",
      "oven, and kneaded the dough.” She pushed poor Grethel out to the oven,\n",
      "from which flames of fire were darting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Creep in,” said the Witch, “and see if it is properly heated, so\n",
      "that we can shut the bread in.” And when once Grethel was inside, she\n",
      "intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then eat her, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Grethel saw what she had in her mind, and would not creep in.\n",
      "“Silly Goose,” said the Old Woman; “the door is big enough. Just look,\n",
      "I can get in myself!” and she crept up and thrust her head in. Then she\n",
      "fell over into the oven and was miserably burnt to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grethel, however, ran as quick as lightning to Haensel, opened his\n",
      "little stable, and cried, “Haensel, we are saved! The old Witch is\n",
      "dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Haensel sprang out like a bird from its cage, when the door is\n",
      "opened for it. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance\n",
      "about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear\n",
      "her, they went into the Witch’s house, and in every corner there stood\n",
      "chests full of pearls and jewels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These are far better than pebbles!” said Haensel, and thrust into his\n",
      "pockets whatever could be got in.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Grethel said, “I, too, will take something home with me,” and\n",
      "filled her pinafore full.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But now we will go away,” said Haensel, “that we may get out of the\n",
      "Witch’s forest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of\n",
      "water. “We cannot get over,” said Haensel, “I see no foot-plank, and no\n",
      "bridge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And no boat crosses either,” answered Grethel, “but a white duck is\n",
      "swimming there. If I ask her, she will help us over.” Then she cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Little Duck, little Duck, dost thou see,\n",
      "      Haensel and Grethel are waiting for thee?\n",
      "      There’s never a plank, nor a bridge in sight,\n",
      "      Take us across on thy back so white._”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duck came to them, and Haensel seated himself on her back, and\n",
      "told his sister to sit by him. “No,” replied Grethel, “that will be\n",
      "too heavy for the little duck. She shall take us across, one after the\n",
      "other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and\n",
      "had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more\n",
      "familiar to them. At length, they saw from afar their father’s house.\n",
      "Then they began to run, rushed into the parlor, and threw themselves\n",
      "into their father’s arms. The man had not known one happy hour since he\n",
      "had left the children in the forest. The woman, however, was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grethel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about\n",
      "the room, and Haensel threw one handful after another out of his pocket\n",
      "to add to them. Then all trouble was at an end, and they lived together\n",
      "in perfect happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make\n",

      "There was once a man who had seven sons, but never a daughter no matter\n",
      "how much he wished for one.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, his wife had a child, and it was a daughter. The joy was\n",
      "great. But the child was sickly and small, and so weak that it had to\n",
      "be baptized at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father sent one of the boys in a hurry to the spring, to fetch\n",
      "water for the baptism. The other six boys ran along with him. And as\n",
      "each strove to be the first to fill the jug, it fell into the spring.\n",
      "There they stood, and did not know what to do. None of them dared to go\n",
      "home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they did not come back, the father grew impatient, and said, “They\n",
      "have forgotten all about it in a game of play, the wicked boys!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon he grew afraid lest the child should die without being baptized,\n",

      "\n",
      "Hardly was the word spoken, before he heard a whirring of wings in\n",

      "flying high and away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parents could not recall the curse. And though they grieved over\n",
      "the loss of their seven sons, yet they comforted themselves somewhat\n",
      "with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day\n",
      "more beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, she did not know that she had had brothers. Her\n",
      "parents were careful not to mention them before her. But one day,\n",
      "she chanced to overhear some people talking about her, and saying,\n",
      "“that the maiden is certainly beautiful, but really to blame for the\n",
      "misfortune of her seven brothers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother, and\n",
      "asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what was become of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parents did not dare to keep the secret longer, and said that her\n",
      "birth was only the innocent cause of what had happened to her brothers.\n",
      "But the maiden laid it daily to heart, and thought that she must\n",
      "deliver her brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no peace and rest until she set out secretly, and went forth\n",
      "into the wide world to seek them out, and set them free, let it cost\n",
      "what it might. She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging\n",
      "to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little\n",
      "pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision\n",
      "against weariness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, she went continually onward, far, far, to the very end of the\n",
      "world. Then she came to the Sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and\n",
      "devoured little children. Hastily she ran away, and ran to the Moon,\n",
      "but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious. And when it saw\n",
      "the child, it said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_I smell, I smell\n",
      "      The flesh of men!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On this she ran swiftly away, and came to the Stars, which were kind\n",
      "and good to her, and each of them sat on its own little chair. But the\n",
      "Morning Star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said,\n",

      "\n",
      "The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and\n",

      "she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good Star’s\n",
      "present. What was she now to do? She wished to rescue her brothers, and\n",
      "had no key to the Glass Mountain. The good little sister took a knife,\n",
      "cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in\n",

      "“I am looking for my brothers, the Seven Ravens,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dwarf said, “The Lord Ravens are not at home, but if you wish to\n",
      "wait here until they come, step in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the little Dwarf carried the Ravens’ dinner in, on seven\n",
      "little plates, and in seven little glasses. The little sister ate a\n",
      "morsel from each plate, and from each little glass she took a sip. But\n",
      "in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought\n",
      "away with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air,\n",
      "and then the little Dwarf said, “Now the Lord Ravens are flying home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their\n",
      "little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other, “Who has\n",
      "eaten something from my plate? Who has drunk out of my little glass? It\n",
      "was a human mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled\n",
      "against his mouth. Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring\n",
      "belonging to his father and mother, and said, “God grant that our\n",
      "little sister may be here, and then we shall be free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that\n",

      "“Dear Child, be good and pious, and then the dear God will always\n",
      "protect you, and I will look down on you from Heaven and be near you.”\n",
      "Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, the maiden went out to her mother’s grave and wept, and she\n",

      "over the grave, and when the spring-sun had drawn it off again, the man\n",

      "\n",
      "The woman had brought two daughters into the house with her, who were\n",
      "beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart. Now began a\n",
      "bad time for the poor child. “Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor\n",

      "\n",

      "kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up before\n",
      "daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash. Besides this, the\n",
      "sisters did her every imaginable injury--they mocked her and emptied\n",
      "her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was forced to sit and\n",
      "pick them out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when she had worked till she was weary, she had no bed\n",
      "to go to, but had to sleep by the fireside in the ashes. And as on that\n",
      "account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her Ash-Maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened once that the father was going to the Fair, and he asked\n",
      "the two daughters what he should bring back for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beautiful dresses,” said one. “Pearls and jewels,” said the second.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Father, break off for me the first branch which knocks against your\n",
      "hat on your way home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for the two\n",
      "daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green\n",
      "thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then\n",
      "he broke off the branch and took it with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached home he gave the two daughters the things which\n",
      "they had wished for, and to Ash-Maiden he gave the branch from the\n",
      "hazel-bush. Ash-Maiden thanked him, went to her mother’s grave and\n",
      "planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on\n",
      "it and watered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It grew, however, and became a handsome tree. Thrice a day Ash-Maiden\n",
      "went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little White Bird\n",
      "always came on the tree. And if Ash-Maiden expressed a wish, the bird\n",
      "threw down to her what she had wished for.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the King gave a feast, which was to last three days.\n",

      "in order that his son might choose himself a Bride. When the two\n",
      "sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were\n",
      "delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "They called Ash-Maiden and said, “Comb our hair, brush our shoes, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Ash-Maiden obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go\n",
      "with them to the dance, and she begged her mother to allow her to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You go, Ash-Maiden!” said she; “you are dusty and dirty, and would go\n",
      "to the feast? You have no clothes and shoes, and yet would dance!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As, however, Ash-Maiden went on asking, the mother at last said, “I\n",

      "picked them out again in two hours, you shall go with us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden went through the back-door into the garden, and called, “You\n",

      "whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. And the\n",
      "pigeons nodded with their heads and began _pick, pick, pick, pick,_\n",
      "and the rest began also _pick, pick, pick, pick,_ and gathered all the\n",
      "good grains into the dish. Hardly had one hour passed before they had\n",
      "finished, and all flew out again.\n",
      "\n",

      "But the mother said, “All this will not help you. You go not with us,\n",
      "for you have no clothes and cannot dance. We should be ashamed of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she turned her back on Ash-Maiden, and hurried away with her two\n",

      "\n",
      "As no one was now at home, Ash-Maiden went to her mother’s grave\n",

      "\n",
      "Her sisters and the mother, however, did not know her, and thought she\n",
      "must be a foreign Princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden\n",
      "dress. They never once thought of Ash-Maiden, and believed that she was\n",
      "sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince went to meet her, took her by the hand, and he danced with\n",
      "her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never let go of her hand.\n",
      "And if any one else came to invite her, he said, “This is my partner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the\n",
      "King’s Son said, “I will go with you and bear you company,” for he\n",
      "wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.\n",
      "\n",
      "She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon-house. The\n",
      "King’s Son waited until her father came, and then he told him that the\n",
      "stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house. The old man thought,\n",
      "“Can it be Ash-Maiden?” and they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe\n",
      "that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they got home, Ash-Maiden lay in her dirty clothes among the\n",
      "ashes, and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantelpiece. For\n",
      "Ash-Maiden had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house,\n",
      "and had run to the little hazel-tree. There she had taken off her\n",
      "beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken\n",
      "them away again. Then she had placed herself in the kitchen amongst the\n",
      "ashes, in her gray gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day, when the feast began afresh, and her parents and the sisters\n",

      "    “_Shiver and quiver, Little Tree,\n",
      "      Silver and gold throw over me!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the\n",
      "preceding day. And when Ash-Maiden appeared at the feast in this dress,\n",
      "every one was astonished at her beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the\n",
      "hand and danced with no one but her. When others came and invited her,\n",
      "he said, “She is my partner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When evening arrived, she wished to leave, and the King’s Son followed\n",
      "her, and wanted to see into which house she went. But she sprang\n",
      "away from him, and into the garden behind the house. Therein stood\n",
      "a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears. She\n",
      "clambered, like a squirrel, so nimbly between the branches, that the\n",
      "King’s Son did not know where she was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited until her father came, and said to him, “The stranger-maiden\n",
      "has escaped from me, and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The father thought, “Can it be Ash-Maiden?” and had an axe brought and\n",
      "cut the tree down, but no one was on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they got into the kitchen, Ash-Maiden lay there amongst the\n",
      "ashes, as usual, for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree,\n",
      "had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and\n",
      "had put on her gray gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away,\n",
      "Ash-Maiden went once more to her mother’s grave, and said to the little\n",
      "tree:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Shiver and quiver, Little Tree,\n",
      "      Silver and gold throw over me!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and\n",
      "magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were golden.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when she went to the feast in the dress, no one knew how to speak\n",
      "for astonishment. The King’s Son danced with her only, and if any one\n",
      "invited her to dance, he said, “She is my partner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When evening came, Ash-Maiden wished to leave, and the King’s Son was\n",
      "anxious to go with her; but she escaped from him so quickly that he\n",
      "could not follow her. The King’s Son, however, had caused the whole\n",
      "staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had\n",
      "the maiden’s left slipper remained sticking. The King’s Son picked it\n",
      "up, and it was small and dainty, and all golden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, he went with it to the father, and said to him, “No one\n",
      "shall be my wife, but she whose foot this golden slipper fits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then were the two sisters glad, for they had pretty feet. The eldest\n",
      "went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on, and her\n",
      "mother stood by. But she could not get her big toe into it, for the\n",
      "shoe was too small for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her mother gave her a knife, and said, “Cut the toe off. When you\n",
      "are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed\n",
      "the pain, and went out to the King’s Son. Then he took her on his horse\n",
      "as his Bride, and rode away with her. They were, however, obliged to\n",
      "pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree, sat the two pigeons and\n",
      "cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Turn and peep, turn and peep,\n",
      "      There’s blood within the shoe!\n",

      "      The true Bride waits for you!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked at her foot, and saw how the blood was streaming from\n",
      "it. He turned his horse round and took the false Bride home again, and\n",
      "said she was not the true one, and that the other sister was to put the\n",
      "shoe on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the\n",
      "shoe, but her heel was too large.\n",
      "\n",
      "So her mother gave her a knife, and said, “Cut a bit off your heel.\n",
      "When you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe,\n",
      "swallowed the pain, and went out to the King’s Son. He took her on his\n",
      "horse as his Bride, and rode away with her. But when they passed by the\n",
      "hazel-tree, two little pigeons sat on it, and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Turn and peep, turn and peep,\n",

      "      The true Bride waits for you!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at her foot, and saw how the blood was running out of\n",
      "her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking. Then he turned his\n",
      "horse and took the false Bride home again. “This also is not the right\n",
      "one,” said he. “Have you no other daughter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the man; “there is only a little stunted kitchen-girl which\n",
      "my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the Bride.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son said he was to send her up to him; but the mother\n",
      "answered, “Oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He insisted on it, and Ash-Maiden had to be called. She first washed\n",
      "her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the\n",
      "King’s Son, who gave her the golden shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy\n",
      "wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when she rose up and the King’s Son looked at her face he\n",
      "recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him, and cried,\n",
      "“That is the true Bride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with\n",
      "rage. He, however, took Ash-Maiden on his horse and rode away with her.\n",
      "As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried:\n",

      "    “_Turn and peep, turn and peep,\n",
      "      No blood is in the shoe!\n",

      "When the wedding with the King’s Son had to be celebrated, the two\n",

      "share her good fortune. When the betrothed couple went to church,\n",
      "the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left, and the\n",
      "pigeons pecked out one eye of each of them. Afterward as they came\n",
      "back, the elder was at the left, and the younger at the right, and\n",
      "then the pigeons pecked out the other eye of each. And thus, for their\n",

      "A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he\n",

      "he cut out the shoes which he wished to make the next morning. And as\n",
      "he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed, commended\n",
      "himself to God, and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to\n",
      "sit down to work, lo! both shoes stood all finished on his table. He\n",
      "was astounded, and did not know what to say. He took the shoes in\n",
      "his hands to examine them closer, and they were so neatly made that\n",
      "there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they were meant for a\n",
      "masterpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him well, he paid\n",

      "with fresh courage; but he had no need to do so, for, when he got up,\n",
      "they were already made. And buyers also were not wanting, who gave him\n",
      "money enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following morning, too, he found the four pairs made. And so it\n",
      "went on constantly, what he cut out in the evening was finished by\n",
      "morning, so that he soon had his honest living again, and at last\n",

      "Now it befell that, one evening not long before Christmas, when the man\n",

      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that he reached the same public-house in which his\n",
      "brother’s table had been exchanged. He led his Ass by the bridle, and\n",
      "the host was about to take the animal from him to tie him up, but the\n",
      "young apprentice said, “Don’t trouble yourself. I will take my gray\n",
      "horse into the stable, and tie him up myself, for I must know where he\n",
      "stands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who was forced\n",
      "to look after his Ass himself, could not have much to spend. But when\n",
      "the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold\n",
      "pieces, and said he was to provide something good for him, the host\n",
      "opened his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could muster.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, the guest asked what he owed. The host did not see why he\n",
      "should not double the reckoning, and said the apprentice must give two\n",
      "more gold pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt in his pocket, but his gold was just at an end. “Wait an\n",
      "instant, sir host,” said he, “I will go and fetch some money;” but he\n",
      "took the tablecloth with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host could not imagine what this could mean, and being curious,\n",
      "stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable-door, he peeped\n",
      "through a hole left by a knot in the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bricklebrit!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall, so that it\n",
      "fairly rained down money on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh, my word!” said the host, “ducats are quickly coined there! A purse\n",
      "like that is not amiss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The guest paid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host\n",
      "stole down into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied\n",
      "up another ass in his place. Early next morning, the apprentice went\n",
      "away with the ass, and thought that he had his Gold-Ass.\n",
      "\n",
      "At midday he reached his father, who rejoiced to see him again, and\n",
      "gladly took him in. “What have you made of yourself, my Son?” asked the\n",
      "old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A miller, dear Father,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have you brought back with you from your travels?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing else but an ass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are asses enough here,” said the father. “I would rather have\n",
      "had a good goat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied the son, “but it is no common ass, but a Gold-Ass. When\n",
      "I say:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Bricklebrit!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "the good beast opens its mouth and drops a whole sheetful of gold\n",
      "pieces. Just summon all our relations hither, and I will make them rich\n",
      "folk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That suits me well,” said the tailor, “for then I shall have no need\n",
      "to torment myself any longer with the needle;” and he ran out and\n",
      "called the relations together.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way, spread\n",
      "out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room. “Now watch,” said he,\n",
      "and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bricklebrit!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "but no gold pieces fell, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing\n",
      "of the art, for every ass does not attain such perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the poor miller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and\n",
      "begged pardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came.\n",
      "There was no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle\n",
      "once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner, and as that is\n",
      "skilled labor, he was the longest in learning. His brothers, however,\n",
      "told him in a letter how badly things had gone with them, and how the\n",
      "innkeeper had cheated them of their beautiful wishing-gifts on the last\n",
      "evening before they reached home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the turner had served his time, and had to set out on his travels,\n",
      "as he had conducted himself so well, his master presented him with a\n",
      "sack, and said, “There is a Cudgel in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can put on the sack,” said he, “and it may be of good service to me,\n",
      "but why should the Cudgel be in it? It only makes it heavy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will tell you why,” replied the master; “if any one has done\n",
      "anything to injure you, do but say:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Cudgel!\n",
      "      Out of the sack!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "and the Cudgel will leap forth among the people, and play such a dance\n",
      "on their backs, that they will not be able to stir or move for a week,\n",
      "and it will not leave off until you say:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Cudgel!\n",
      "      Into the sack!_’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The apprentice thanked him, put the sack on his back, and when any one\n",
      "came too near him, and wished to attack him, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Cudgel!\n",
      "      Out of the sack!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and instantly the Cudgel sprang out, and dusted the coat or jacket of\n",
      "one after the other on their backs, and never stopped until it had\n",
      "stripped it off them. And it was done so quickly, that before any one\n",
      "was aware, it was already his own turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, the young turner reached the inn where his brothers\n",
      "had been cheated. He laid his sack on the table before him, and began\n",
      "to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world.\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, “people may easily find a Little Table which will cover\n",
      "itself, a Gold-Ass, and things of that kind--extremely good things\n",
      "which I by no means despise--but these are nothing in comparison with\n",
      "the treasure which I have won for myself, and am carrying about with me\n",
      "in my sack there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The innkeeper pricked up his ears. “What in the world can that be?”\n",
      "thought he. “The sack must be filled with nothing but jewels. I ought\n",
      "to get them cheap too, for all good things go in threes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was time for sleep, the guest stretched himself on the bench,\n",
      "and laid his sack beneath him for a pillow. When the innkeeper thought\n",
      "his guest was lying in a sound sleep, he went to him and pushed and\n",
      "pulled quite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could\n",
      "possibly draw it away and lay another in its place. The turner had,\n",
      "however, been waiting for this for a long time; and now, just as the\n",
      "innkeeper was about to give a hearty tug, he cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Cudgel!\n",
      "      Out of the sack!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the little Cudgel came forth, and fell on the innkeeper, and\n",
      "gave him a sound thrashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host cried for mercy. But the louder he cried, so much the more\n",
      "heavily the Cudgel beat time on his back, until at length he fell to\n",
      "the ground exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the turner said, “If you do not give back the Little Table that\n",
      "sets itself, and the Gold-Ass, the dance shall begin afresh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” cried the host, quite humbly, “I will gladly bring out\n",
      "everything, only make the accursed Kobold creep back into the sack!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the apprentice, “I will let mercy take the place of justice,\n",
      "but beware of getting into mischief again!” So he cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Cudgel!\n",
      "      Into the sack!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and let him have rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, the turner went home to his father with the\n",
      "Wishing-Table, and the Gold-Ass. The tailor rejoiced when he saw him\n",
      "once more, and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Father,” said he, “I have become a turner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A skilled trade,” said the father. “What have you brought back with\n",
      "you from your travels?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A precious thing, dear Father,” replied the son, “a Cudgel in the\n",
      "sack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” cried the father, “a Cudgel! That’s worth your trouble, indeed!\n",
      "From every tree you can cut one for yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But not one like this, dear Father. If I say:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Cudgel!\n",
      "      Out of the sack!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "the Cudgel springs out and leads any one, who means ill by me, a weary\n",
      "dance, and never stops until he lies on the ground and prays for fair\n",
      "weather. Look you, with this Cudgel have I got back the Wishing-Table\n",
      "and the Gold-Ass, which the thievish innkeeper took away from my\n",
      "brothers. Now let them both be sent for, and invite all our kinsmen. I\n",
      "will give them to eat and to drink, and will fill their pockets with\n",
      "gold into the bargain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old tailor would not quite believe, but nevertheless got the\n",
      "relatives together. Then the turner spread a cloth in the room, and led\n",
      "in the Gold-Ass, and said to his brother, “Now, dear Brother, speak to\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The miller said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bricklebrit!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and instantly the gold pieces fell down on the cloth like a\n",
      "thunder-shower, and the Ass did not stop until every one of them had so\n",
      "much that he could carry no more. (I can see in your face that you also\n",
      "would have liked to be there!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the turner brought the Little Table, and said, “Now, dear Brother,\n",
      "speak to it.” And scarcely had the carpenter said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Little Table!\n",
      "      Set thyself!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "than it was spread, and covered with the most exquisite dishes. Then\n",
      "such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet known in his\n",
      "house. The whole party of kinsmen stayed together till far in the\n",
      "night, and were all merry and glad. The tailor locked away needle and\n",
      "thread, yard-measure and goose, in a press, and lived with his three\n",
      "sons in joy and splendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, however, has become of the goat, who was to blame for the tailor\n",
      "driving out his three sons? That I will tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox’s hole and\n",
      "crept into it. When the fox came home, he was met by two great eyes\n",
      "shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away. A bear\n",
      "met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said, “What is the\n",
      "matter with you, brother Fox, why do you look like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” answered Redskin, “a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me\n",
      "with its fiery eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will soon drive him out,” said the bear, and went with him to the\n",
      "cave and looked in. But when he saw the fiery eyes, fear seized him\n",
      "likewise. He would have nothing to do with the furious beast, and took\n",
      "to his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said,\n",
      "“Bear, you are really pulling a very pitiful face. What has become of\n",
      "all your jollity?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all very well for you to talk,” replied the bear, “a furious\n",
      "beast with staring eyes is in Redskin’s house, and we can’t drive him\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bee said, “Bear, I pity you! I am a poor weak creature, whom you\n",
      "would not turn aside to look at. Yet I believe I can help you.” She\n",
      "flew into the fox’s cave, lighted on the goat’s clean, shaved head, and\n",
      "stung her so hard that she sprang up crying, “_Ma! ma!_” and ran forth\n",
      "into the world like mad; and to this hour no one knows where she has\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once on a time there was a King who had a great forest near his palace,\n",
      "full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to\n",
      "shoot him a roe, but he did not come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps some accident has befallen him,” said the King, and the next\n",
      "day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they\n",
      "too stayed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, “Scour\n",
      "the whole forest through, and do not give up until ye have found all\n",
      "three.” But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of\n",
      "hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen more.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\n",
      "and it lay in deep stillness and solitude. Nothing was seen but\n",
      "sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many\n",
      "years, when a strange huntsman came to the King asking for work, and\n",
      "offered to go into the dangerous forest. The King, however, would not\n",
      "give his consent, and said, “It is not safe in there. I fear it would\n",
      "fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come\n",
      "out again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman replied, “Lord, I will venture it at my own risk; of fear\n",
      "I know nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It\n",
      "was not long before the dog fell in with some game, and wanted to\n",
      "pursue it. But hardly had the dog run two steps when he stood before a\n",
      "deep pool and could go no farther. Then a naked arm stretched itself\n",
      "out of the water, seized him, and drew him under.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come\n",
      "with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see the bottom,\n",
      "there lay a Wild Man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose\n",
      "hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords,\n",
      "and led him away to the castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was great astonishment over the Wild Man. The King had him put\n",
      "in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\n",
      "on pain of death, and the Queen herself was to take the key into her\n",
      "keeping. And from this time forth, every one could once more go into\n",
      "the forest with safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King had a son, eight years old, who one day was playing in the\n",
      "courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the\n",
      "cage. The boy ran thither and said, “Give me my ball.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not till you have opened the door for me,” answered the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the boy, “I will not do that. The King has forbidden it,”\n",
      "and ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day he again went and asked for his ball. The Wild Man said,\n",
      "“Open my door,” but the boy would not.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day when the King had ridden out hunting, the boy went\n",
      "once more and said, “I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I\n",
      "have not the key.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Wild Man said, “It lies under your mother’s pillow. You can\n",
      "get it there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the\n",
      "winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the\n",
      "boy pinched his fingers. When it was open, the Wild Man stepped out,\n",
      "gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the boy was afraid. He called and cried after him, “Oh, Wild Man,\n",
      "do not go away, or I shall be beaten!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wild Man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and\n",
      "went with hasty steps into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King came home, he saw the empty cage, and asked the Queen how\n",
      "that had happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but\n",
      "it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The King sent out\n",
      "people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then\n",
      "he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the\n",
      "Royal Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Wild Man had reached once more the dark forest, he took the\n",
      "boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, “You will never see your\n",
      "father and mother again, but I will keep you with me for you have set\n",
      "me free, and I pity you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well.\n",
      "Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than any one in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept. And the next\n",
      "morning, the man took him to a well, and said, “Behold, the gold well\n",
      "is as bright and clear as crystal; you shall sit beside it, and take\n",
      "care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come\n",
      "every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy placed himself by the margin of the well, and often saw a\n",
      "golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and he took care\n",
      "that nothing fell in. As he was sitting thus, his finger hurt him so\n",
      "violently that without thinking he put it in the water. He drew it\n",
      "quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded. And whatsoever\n",
      "pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, Iron John came back, looked at the boy, and said, “What\n",
      "has happened to the well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing, nothing,” he answered, and held his finger behind his back,\n",
      "that the man might not see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he said, “You have dipped your finger into the water. This time it\n",
      "may pass, but take care you do not again let anything get in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.\n",
      "His finger hurt him again, and he passed it over his head, and then\n",
      "unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but\n",
      "it was quite gilded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iron John came, and already knew what had happened. “You have let a\n",
      "hair fall into the well,” said he. “I will allow you to watch by it\n",
      "once more, but if this happens the third time, then the well will be\n",
      "polluted, and you can no longer remain with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\n",
      "however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked\n",
      "at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\n",
      "still bent down more and more trying to look straight into the eyes,\n",
      "his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised\n",
      "himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was golden,\n",
      "and shone like the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man\n",
      "might not see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came, he already knew everything, and said, “Take off the\n",
      "handkerchief.” Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy\n",
      "excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. “You have not stood the\n",
      "trial, and can no longer stay here. Go forth into the world. There you\n",
      "will learn what poverty is. But as you have not a bad heart, and as I\n",
      "mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you. If you fall into\n",
      "any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, ‘Iron John,’ and then I\n",
      "will come and help you. My power is great, greater than you think, and\n",
      "I have gold and silver in abundance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King’s Son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\n",
      "paths ever onward, until at length he reached a great city. There he\n",
      "looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by\n",
      "which he could help himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in.\n",
      "The people about Court did not know what use to make of him, but they\n",
      "liked him, and told him to stay. At last, the cook took him into his\n",
      "service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once when it happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered\n",
      "him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to\n",
      "let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little hat on. Such a thing\n",
      "as that had never come under the King’s notice, and he said, “When you\n",
      "serve at the royal table you must take off your hat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, “Ah, Lord, I cannot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King had the cook called before him. He scolded him, and asked\n",
      "how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and said that he\n",
      "was to turn him off at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and\n",
      "exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and\n",
      "bear the wind and bad weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was\n",
      "so warm he took his little hat off that the air might cool him. As the\n",
      "sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell\n",
      "into the bedroom of the King’s Daughter. Up she sprang to see what it\n",
      "could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, “Boy, bring me a\n",
      "wreath of flowers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He put his hat on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and\n",
      "bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the\n",
      "gardener met him, and said, “How can you take the King’s Daughter a\n",
      "garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and\n",
      "seek out the prettiest and rarest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” replied the boy, “the wild ones have more scent, and will\n",
      "please her better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he went into the room, the King’s Daughter said, “Take your cap\n",
      "off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He again said, “I cannot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She, however, caught at his hat and pulled it off, and then his golden\n",
      "hair rolled down on his shoulders. And it was splendid to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a\n",
      "handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the\n",
      "gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said, “I give them to\n",
      "your children, they may play with them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day, the King’s Daughter again called to him that he was\n",
      "to bring her a wreath of field-flowers. When he went in with it, she\n",
      "snatched at his hat, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held\n",
      "it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats. But he\n",
      "would not keep them, and presented them to the gardener as playthings\n",
      "for his children.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day, things went just the same. She could not get his hat\n",
      "away from him, and he would not have her money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long afterward, the country was overrun by war. The King gathered\n",
      "together his people, and did not know whether or not he could overcome\n",
      "the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the gardener’s boy, “I am grown up, and will go to the wars\n",
      "also, only give me a horse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The others laughed, and said, “Seek one for yourself when we are gone.\n",
      "We will leave one behind us in the stable for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and got the horse.\n",
      "It was lame of one foot, and limped _hobblety jig, hobblety jig_.\n",
      "Nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he\n",
      "came to the outskirts, he called “Iron John” three times so loudly that\n",
      "it echoed through the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the Wild Man appeared immediately, and said, “What do you\n",
      "desire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you shall have, and still more than you ask.” Then the Wild Man\n",
      "went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy\n",
      "came out of it, who led a horse that snorted, and could hardly be\n",
      "restrained. Behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely\n",
      "equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made\n",
      "over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and\n",
      "rode at the head of the soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he drew near the battle-field, a great part of the King’s men\n",
      "had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way.\n",
      "Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a\n",
      "hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began\n",
      "to fly, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a\n",
      "single man left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, however, of returning to the King, he conducted his troop by\n",
      "side-roads to the forest, and called Iron John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you desire?” asked the Wild Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take back your horse and troops, and give me my three-legged horse\n",
      "again.” All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his\n",
      "three-legged horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him,\n",
      "and wished him joy of his victory. “I am not the one who carried away\n",
      "the victory,” said he, “but a stranger Knight who came to my assistance\n",
      "with his soldiers.” The daughter wanted to hear who the strange Knight\n",
      "was, but the King did not know, and said, “He followed the enemy, and I\n",
      "did not see him again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and\n",
      "said, “He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others\n",
      "have been mocking him, and crying, ‘Here comes our hobblety jig back\n",
      "again!’ They asked, too, ‘Under what hedge have you been lying sleeping\n",
      "all the time?’ He, however, answered, ‘I did the best of all, and it\n",
      "would have gone badly without me.’ And then he was ridiculed still\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said to his daughter, “I will proclaim a great feast that\n",
      "shall last for three days, and you shall throw a Golden Apple. Perhaps\n",
      "the unknown will come to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and\n",
      "called Iron John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you desire?” asked he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I may catch the King’s Daughter’s Golden Apple.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is as safe as if you had it already,” said Iron John. “You shall\n",
      "likewise have a suit of red armor for the occasion, and ride on a\n",
      "spirited chestnut horse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place\n",
      "amongst the Knights, and was recognized by no one. The King’s Daughter\n",
      "came forward, and threw a Golden Apple to the Knights. None of them\n",
      "caught it but he; only as soon as he had it, he galloped away.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second day, Iron John equipped him as a white Knight, and gave\n",
      "him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\n",
      "he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King grew angry, and said, “That is not allowed. He must appear\n",
      "before me and tell his name.” He gave the order that if the Knight who\n",
      "caught the apple should go away again, they should pursue him, and, if\n",
      "he would not come back willingly, they should cut him down and stab him.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day, he received from Iron John a suit of black armor and\n",
      "a black horse. Again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\n",
      "with it, the King’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\n",
      "that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The youth\n",
      "nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that\n",
      "the helmet fell from his head, and they could see that he had golden\n",
      "hair. They rode back and announced this to the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day, the King’s Daughter asked the gardener about his\n",
      "boy. “He is at work in the garden. The queer creature has been at the\n",
      "festival too, and only came home yesterday evening. He has likewise\n",
      "shown my children three Golden Apples which he has won.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King had him summoned into his presence. He came and again had his\n",
      "hat on his head. But the King’s Daughter went up to him and took it\n",
      "off. Then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so\n",
      "handsome that all were amazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you the Knight who came every day to the festival, always in\n",
      "different colors, and who caught the three Golden Apples?” asked the\n",
      "King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered he, “and here are the apples,” and he took them out\n",
      "of his pocket, and returned them to the King. “If you desire further\n",
      "proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they\n",
      "followed me. But I am likewise the Knight who helped you win your\n",
      "victory over your enemies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy. Tell\n",
      "me, who is your father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as much as I\n",
      "require.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I well see,” said the King, “that I owe thanks to you. Can I do\n",
      "anything to please you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered he, “that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to\n",
      "wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden laughed, and said, “He does not stand much on ceremony, but\n",
      "I have already seen by his golden hair that he is no gardener’s boy,”\n",
      "and then she went and kissed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight,\n",

      "as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped,\n",
      "the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, “I am Iron John, and\n",
      "was by enchantment a Wild Man, but you have set me free. All the\n",

      "There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.\n",
      "And when she had grown up her father said, “We will get her married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the mother, “if only any one would come who would have her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At length a man came from a distance, and wooed her, who was called\n",
      "Hans. But he made one condition, that Clever Elsie should be really\n",
      "wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said the father, “she’s sharp enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And the mother said, “Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street,\n",
      "and hear the flies coughing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Hans, “if she is not really wise, I won’t have her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were sitting at dinner, and had eaten, the mother said,\n",
      "“Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar,\n",
      "and tapped the lid briskly as she went that the time might not appear\n",
      "long. When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before\n",
      "the barrel, so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her\n",
      "back or do herself any unexpected injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the\n",
      "beer was running, she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at\n",
      "the wall. And after much peering here and there, saw a pickaxe exactly\n",
      "above her, which the masons had left there by mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said, “If I get Hans, and we have a\n",
      "child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\n",
      "beer, then the pickaxe will fall on his head and kill him.” Then she\n",
      "sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\n",
      "misfortune which lay before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those upstairs waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not\n",
      "come. Then the woman said to the servant, “Just go down into the cellar\n",
      "and see where Elsie is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah,” she answered, “have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we\n",
      "have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pickaxe\n",
      "may fall on his head, and kill him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the maid, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat down beside\n",
      "her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were\n",
      "thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy, “Just go down into the\n",
      "cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both\n",
      "weeping together. Then he asked, “Why are you weeping?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said Elsie, “have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we\n",

      "is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their\n",
      "lamentations, and inquired what was the cause. Then Elsie told her\n",
      "also, that her future child was to be killed by the pickaxe, when it\n",
      "grew big and had to draw beer, and the pickaxe fell down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the mother likewise, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat\n",
      "down and wept with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back\n",
      "and his thirst grew ever greater, he said, “I must go into the cellar\n",
      "myself and see where Elsie is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together\n",
      "crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie’s child was the cause,\n",
      "and that Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and\n",
      "that it might be killed by the pickaxe, if it should happen to be\n",
      "sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell, he\n",
      "cried, “Oh, what a clever Elsie!” and sat down, and likewise wept with\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bridegroom stayed up-stairs alone for a long time; then as no one\n",
      "came back he thought, “They must be waiting for me below. I, too, must\n",
      "go there and see what they are about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he got down, all five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\n",
      "quite piteously, each outdoing the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What misfortune has happened then?” asked he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, dear Hans,” said Elsie, “if we marry each other and have a child,\n",
      "and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink,\n",
      "then the pickaxe which has been left up there might dash his brains\n",
      "out, if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said Hans, “more understanding than that is not needed for my\n",
      "household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,” and he\n",
      "seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Hans had had her some time, he said, “Wife, I am going out to\n",
      "work and earn money for us. Go into the field and cut the corn, that we\n",
      "may have some bread.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth, and took\n",
      "it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to\n",
      "herself, “What shall I do? Shall I shear first, or shall I eat first?\n",
      "Oh, I will eat first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she emptied her basin of broth, and when she was fully satisfied,\n",
      "she once more said, “What shall I do? Shall I shear first, or shall I\n",
      "sleep first? I will sleep first.” Then she lay down among the corn and\n",
      "fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come. Then\n",
      "said he, “What a clever Elsie I have. She is so industrious, that she\n",
      "does not even come home to eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As, however, she still stayed away, and it was evening, Hans went out\n",
      "to see what she had cut. But nothing was cut, and she was lying among\n",
      "the corn, asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler’s net\n",
      "with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on\n",
      "sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his\n",
      "chair and worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got\n",
      "up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each\n",
      "step which she took. Then she was frightened, and became uncertain\n",
      "whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said, “Is it I, or is\n",
      "it not I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in\n",
      "doubt. At length she thought, “I will go home and ask if it be I, or if\n",
      "it be not I. They will be sure to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut. Then she knocked\n",
      "at the window and cried, “Hans, is Elsie within?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Hans, “she is within.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereupon she was terrified, and said, “Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,”\n",
      "and went to another door.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the people heard the jingling of the bells, they would not\n",
      "open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village,\n",

      "“There,” he thought, “I can surely be town-musician.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had walked some distance, he found a Hound lying on the road,\n",
      "gasping like one who had run till he was tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you gasping so for, you big fellow?” asked the Donkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” replied the Hound, “as I am old, and daily grow weaker and no\n",
      "longer can hunt, my master wants to kill me. So I have taken to flight.\n",
      "But now how am I to earn my bread?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell you what,” said the Donkey, “I am going to Bremen, and shall\n",
      "be town-musician there. Come with me and engage yourself also as a\n",
      "musician. I will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettledrum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hound agreed, and on they went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long, they came to a Cat, sitting on the path, with a face like\n",
      "three rainy days!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now then, old shaver, what has gone askew with you?” asked the Donkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who can be merry when his neck is in danger?” answered the Cat.\n",
      "“Because I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to stumps, and I\n",
      "prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about after mice,\n",
      "my mistress wants to drown me, so I have run away. But now good advice\n",
      "is scarce. Where am I to go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come with us to Bremen. You understand night-music, so you can be a\n",
      "town-musician.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat thought well of it, and went with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this the three fugitives came to a farmyard, where the Cock was\n",
      "sitting upon the gate, crowing with all his might.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your crow goes through and through one,” said the Donkey. “What is the\n",
      "matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on\n",
      "which Our Lady washes the Christ-child’s little shirts, and wants to\n",
      "dry them,” said the Cock. “But guests are coming for Sunday, so the\n",
      "housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me\n",
      "in the soup to-morrow. This evening I am to have my head cut off. Now I\n",
      "am crowing at full pitch while I can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, but Red-Comb,” said the Donkey, “you had better come away with\n",
      "us. We are going to Bremen. You can find something better than death\n",
      "everywhere. You have a good voice, and if we make music together, it\n",
      "must have some quality!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cock agreed to this plan, and all four went on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could not, however, reach the city of Bremen in one day, and in\n",
      "the evening they came to a forest where they meant to pass the night.\n",
      "The Donkey and the Hound laid themselves down under a large tree. The\n",
      "Cat and the Cock settled themselves in the branches; but the Cock flew\n",
      "right to the top, where he was most safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he went to sleep, he looked round on all the four sides, and\n",
      "thought he saw in the distance a little spark burning. So he called out\n",
      "to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a\n",
      "light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Donkey said, “If so, we had better get up and go on, for the\n",
      "shelter here is bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hound thought that a few bones with some meat would do him good too!\n",
      "\n",
      "They made their way to the place where the light was, and soon saw\n",
      "it shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to a well-lighted\n",
      "robber’s house. The Donkey, as the biggest, went to the window and\n",
      "looked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you see, my Grey-Horse?” asked the Cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I see?” answered the Donkey; “a table covered with good things\n",
      "to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be the sort of thing for us,” said the Cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes! ah, how I wish we were there!” said the Donkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the animals took counsel together as to how they could drive away\n",
      "the robbers, and at last they thought of a plan. The Donkey was to\n",
      "place himself with his forefeet upon the window-ledge, the Hound was\n",
      "to jump on the Donkey’s back, the Cat was to climb upon the Hound, and\n",
      "lastly the Cock was to fly up and perch upon the head of the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this was done, at a given signal, they began to perform their\n",
      "music together. The Donkey brayed, the Hound barked, the Cat mewed, and\n",
      "the Cock crowed. Then they burst through the window into the room, so\n",
      "that the glass clattered!\n",
      "\n",
      "At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise\n",
      "than that a ghost had come in, and fled in a great fright out into the\n",
      "forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with what\n",
      "was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the four minstrels had done, they put out the light, and\n",
      "each sought for himself a sleeping-place according to his nature and\n",
      "to what suited him. The Donkey laid himself down upon some straw in\n",
      "the yard, the Hound behind the door, the Cat upon the hearth near the\n",
      "warm ashes, and the Cock perched himself upon a beam of the roof. Being\n",
      "tired with their long walk, they soon went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was past midnight, the robbers saw from afar that the light was\n",
      "no longer burning in their house, and all appeared quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain said, “We ought not to have let ourselves be frightened out\n",
      "of our wits;” and ordered one of them to go and examine the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The messenger finding all still, went into the kitchen to light a\n",
      "candle, and, taking the glistening fiery eyes of the Cat for live\n",
      "coals, he held a lucifer-match to them to light it. But the Cat did not\n",
      "understand the joke, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back door, but the Dog,\n",
      "who lay there, sprang up and bit his leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as he ran across the yard by the straw-heap, the Donkey gave him\n",
      "a smart kick with his hind foot. The Cock, too, who had been awakened\n",
      "by the noise, and had become lively, cried down from the beam:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Kicker-ee-ricker-ee-ree!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain, and said,\n",
      "“Ah, there is a horrible Witch sitting in the house, who spat on me\n",
      "and scratched my face with her long claws. By the door stands a man\n",
      "with a knife, who stabbed me in the leg. In the yard there lies a black\n",
      "monster, who beat me with a wooden club. And above, upon the roof, sits\n",
      "the judge, who called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Bring the rogue here to me!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "so I got away as well as I could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After this the robbers did not trust themselves in the house again. But\n",
      "it suited the four musicians of Bremen so well that they did not care\n",
      "to leave it any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the mouth of him who last told this story, is still warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time, a certain King was hunting in a great forest, and he\n",
      "chased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants could follow\n",
      "him. When evening drew near, he stopped and looked around him, and saw\n",
      "that he had lost his way. He sought a way out, but could find none.\n",
      "Then he perceived an Old Woman with a head which nodded all the time,\n",
      "who came toward him, but she was a Witch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good woman,” said he to her, “can you not show me the way through the\n",
      "forest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, Lord King,” she answered, “that I certainly can, but on one\n",
      "condition, and if you do not fulfill that, you will never get out of\n",
      "the forest, and will die of hunger in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind of a condition is it?” asked the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a daughter,” said the old woman, “who is as beautiful as any\n",
      "one in the world, and well deserves to be your wife. If you will make\n",
      "her your Queen, I will show you the way out of the forest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the anguish of his heart the King consented, and the old woman led\n",
      "him to her little hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire. She\n",
      "received the King as if she had been expecting him. He saw that she was\n",
      "very beautiful, but still she did not please him, and he could not look\n",
      "at her without secret horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him\n",
      "the way, and the King reached his royal palace again, where the wedding\n",
      "was celebrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife,\n",
      "seven children, six boys and a girl, whom he loved better than anything\n",
      "else in the world. As he now feared that the new Queen might not treat\n",
      "them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely\n",
      "castle which stood in the midst of a forest. It lay concealed, and the\n",
      "way was so difficult to find, that he himself would not have found it\n",
      "at all, if a Wise Woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful\n",
      "properties. When he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and\n",
      "showed him his path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King, however, went so frequently to visit his dear children, that\n",
      "the Queen noticed his absence. She was curious and wanted to know what\n",
      "he did when he was alone in the forest. She gave a great deal of money\n",
      "to his servants, and they betrayed the secret to her, and told her\n",
      "likewise of the ball which alone could point out the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now she knew no rest until she had learnt where the King kept the\n",
      "ball of yarn. Then she made little shirts of white silk, and as she had\n",
      "learnt the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a charm inside\n",
      "them. And one day, when the King had ridden forth to hunt, she took the\n",
      "little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the\n",
      "way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children, who saw from a distance that some one was approaching,\n",
      "thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy,\n",
      "ran to meet him. Then she threw one of the little shirts over each of\n",
      "them. And no sooner had the shirts touched their bodies than they were\n",
      "changed into Swans, and flew away over the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of all\n",
      "the children, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the\n",
      "Queen knew nothing about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day, the King went to visit his children, but found no one but the\n",
      "little girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are your brothers?” asked the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, dear Father,” she answered, “they have gone away and left me\n",
      "alone!” and she told him that she had seen from her little window, how\n",
      "her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of Swans. And\n",
      "she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard,\n",
      "and which she had picked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done this\n",
      "wicked deed. And as he feared that the girl also would be stolen from\n",
      "him, he wanted to take her away. But she was afraid of the Queen,\n",
      "and entreated the King to let her stay just one night more in the\n",
      "forest-castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor girl thought, “I can no longer remain here. I will go and seek\n",
      "my brothers.” And when night came, she ran away, and went straight into\n",
      "the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping,\n",
      "until she could go no farther for weariness. Then she saw a forest-hut,\n",
      "and went into it, and found a room with six little beds. She did not\n",
      "venture to get into any of them, but crept under one, and lay down\n",
      "on the hard ground, to pass the night there. Just before sunset she\n",
      "heard a rustling, and saw six Swans come flying in at the window.\n",
      "They alighted on the ground and blew at each other, and blew all the\n",
      "feathers off, and their swan’s skins stripped off like a shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers. She\n",
      "rejoiced and crept forth from beneath the bed. The brothers were not\n",
      "less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was short.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here can you not abide,” they said to her. “This is a shelter for\n",
      "robbers. If they come home and find you, they will kill you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But can you not protect me?” asked the little sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” they replied, “only for one quarter of an hour each evening, can\n",
      "we lay aside our swan’s skins and have our human form. After that, we\n",
      "are once more turned into Swans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little sister wept, and said, “Can you not be set free?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, no,” they answered, “the conditions are too hard! For six years\n",
      "you may neither speak nor laugh, and in that time you must sew together\n",
      "six little shirts of Star-Flowers for us. And if one single word falls\n",
      "from your lips, all your work will be lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over,\n",
      "and they flew out of the window again as Swans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden, however, resolved to deliver her brothers, even if it\n",
      "should cost her her life. She left the hut, went into the midst of the\n",
      "forest, seated herself on a tree, and there passed the night. Next\n",
      "morning, she went out and gathered Star-Flowers and began to sew.\n",
      "She could not speak to any one, and she had no wish to laugh. She sat\n",
      "there and looked at nothing but her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had spent a long time there, it came to pass that the King of\n",
      "the country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen came to the\n",
      "tree on which the maiden was sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "They called to her, and said, “Who are you?” But she made no answer.\n",
      "“Come down to us,” said they. “We will not do you any harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She only shook her head. As they pressed her further with questions,\n",
      "she threw her golden necklace down to them, and thought to content them\n",
      "with that. They, however, did not cease, and then she threw her girdle\n",
      "down to them, and as this also was to no use, her garters, and little\n",
      "by little everything which she had on that she could do without, until\n",
      "she had nothing left but her shift. The huntsmen, however, did not let\n",
      "themselves be turned aside by that, but climbed the tree and fetched\n",
      "the maiden down and led her before the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King asked, “Who are you? What are you doing on the tree?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not answer. He put the question in every language that he\n",
      "knew, but she remained as mute as a fish. As she was so beautiful, the\n",
      "King’s heart was touched, and he was smitten with a great love for her.\n",
      "He put his mantle on her, took her before him on his horse, and carried\n",
      "her to his castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments, and she shone in her\n",
      "beauty like bright daylight, but no word could be drawn from her. He\n",
      "placed her by his side at table, and her modest bearing and courtesy\n",
      "pleased him so much, that he said, “She is the one whom I wish to\n",
      "marry, and no other woman in the world.” And a few days after, he\n",
      "united himself to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King, however, had a wicked mother, who was dissatisfied with his\n",
      "marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen. “Who knows,” said she, “from\n",
      "whence comes the creature, who can’t speak? She is not worthy of a\n",
      "King!”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year had passed, when the Queen brought her first child into\n",
      "the world, the old woman took it away from her and smeared her mouth\n",
      "with blood as she slept. Then she went to the King and accused the\n",
      "Queen of being a man-eater. The King would not believe it, and would\n",
      "not suffer any one to do her injury. She, however, sat continually\n",
      "sewing at the shirts, and cared for nothing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time, when she again bore a beautiful boy, the false old\n",
      "woman used the same treachery, but the King could not bring himself to\n",
      "believe her words. He said, “She is too pious and good to do anything\n",
      "of that kind. If she were not dumb, and could defend herself, her\n",
      "innocence would come to light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the old woman stole away the newly-born child for the third\n",
      "time, and accused the Queen, who did not utter one word of defense, the\n",
      "King could do no otherwise than deliver her over to justice; and she\n",
      "was sentenced to be burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day came for the sentence to be executed, it was the last day\n",
      "of the six years during which she was not to speak or laugh, and she\n",
      "had delivered her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment. The\n",
      "six shirts were ready, only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, therefore, she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her\n",
      "arm. And when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be\n",
      "lighted, she looked around and six Swans came flying through the air\n",
      "toward her. Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart\n",
      "leapt with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Swans swept toward her and sank down so that she could throw the\n",
      "shirts over them. And as they were touched by them, their swan’s skins\n",
      "fell off, and her brothers stood in their own form before her, vigorous\n",
      "and handsome. The youngest lacked only his left arm, and had in its\n",
      "place a swan’s wing on his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "They embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen went to the King,\n",
      "who was greatly moved, and she began to speak, and said, “Dearest\n",
      "Husband, now I may speak and declare to you that I am innocent, and\n",
      "falsely accused.” And she told him of the treachery of the old woman\n",
      "who had taken away her three children, and hidden them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the great joy of the King, they were brought back. And as a\n",
      "punishment, the wicked woman was bound to the stake and burned to ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the King and the Queen, with their six brothers, lived many years\n",
      "in happiness and peace.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a certain mill, lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child.\n",
      "Three apprentices served under him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I\n",
      "am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner. Go out, and whichsoever\n",
      "of you brings me the best horse, to him will I give the mill. And in\n",
      "return for it, he shall take care of me till my death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as\n",
      "foolish by the others. They begrudged the mill to him, and afterward he\n",
      "would not have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village,\n",
      "the two said to stupid Hans, “You may just as well stay here; as long\n",

      "\n",
      "Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a\n",
      "cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until\n",
      "Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him\n",
      "where he was. They thought they had done a very clever thing, but it\n",
      "was certain to turn out ill for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He\n",
      "looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, alas! where am I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, into the forest, thinking:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small Tabby-Cat\n",
      "which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, you cannot help me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I well know your desire,” said the Cat. “You wish to have a beautiful\n",
      "horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years, and\n",
      "then I will give you a horse more beautiful than any you have ever seen\n",
      "in your whole life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, this is a wonderful Cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to\n",
      "see if she is telling the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were\n",
      "nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and\n",
      "downstairs, and were merry and happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make\n",
      "music. One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put\n",
      "the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the Cat said,\n",
      "“Now, Hans, come and dance with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "So one of them lighted him to his bedroom, one pulled his shoes off,\n",
      "one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his\n",
      "stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one\n",
      "washed him, and one dried his face with her tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That feels very soft!” said Hans.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, however, had to serve the Cat, and chop some wood every day. And\n",
      "to do that, he had an axe of silver, while the wedge and saw were of\n",
      "silver and the mallet of copper. So he chopped the wood small.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw\n",
      "any one but the Tabby-Cat and her servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and\n",
      "gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him\n",
      "deliver them up again carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had\n",
      "finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the\n",
      "house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Cat, “you must first do something more for me of the\n",
      "same kind. There is timber of silver, carpenter’s axe, square, and\n",
      "everything that is needful, all of silver, with these build me a small\n",
      "house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done\n",
      "everything, and still he had no horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six\n",
      "months. The Cat asked him if he would like to see her horses?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Hans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she opened the door of the small house. And when she had opened\n",
      "it, there stood twelve horses,--such horses, so bright and shining,\n",
      "that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now she gave him to eat and to drink, and said, “Go home. I will\n",
      "not give you your horse to take away with you. But in three days’ time,\n",
      "I will follow you and bring it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. She had,\n",
      "however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to\n",
      "keep on his dirty old smock-frock, which he had brought with him, and\n",
      "which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again, and\n",
      "each of them certainly had brought a horse with him. But one of them\n",
      "was blind and the other lame. They asked Hans where his horse was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will follow me in three days’ time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they laughed and said, “Indeed, stupid Hans! where will you get a\n",
      "horse? It will be a fine one!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans went into the parlor, but the miller said he should not sit down\n",
      "to table for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed\n",
      "of him if any one came in. So they gave him a mouthful of food outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "At night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have\n",
      "a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie\n",
      "down on a little hard straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach\n",
      "came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to\n",
      "see them!--and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the\n",
      "poor miller’s boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a magnificent Princess alighted from the coach, and went into the\n",
      "mill. And this Princess was the little Tabby-Cat whom poor Hans had\n",
      "served for seven years.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked the miller where the miller’s boy and drudge was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the miller said, “We will not have him here in the mill, he is so\n",
      "ragged. He is lying in the goose-house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King’s Daughter said that they were to fetch him immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they brought him; and he had to hold his little smock together to\n",
      "cover himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed\n",
      "him. And when it was done, no King could have looked more handsome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Princess desired to see the horses, which the other\n",
      "apprentices had brought home with them. One of them was blind and the\n",
      "other lame. So she ordered her servants to bring the seventh horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the miller saw it, he said such a horse as that had never before\n",
      "entered his yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that is for the third miller’s boy,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then he must have the mill,” said the miller.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Princess said that the horse was for himself, and that he was\n",
      "to keep his mill as well. Then she took her faithful Hans, set him in\n",
      "the coach, and drove away with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They first drove to the little house, which he had built with the\n",
      "silver tools. Behold! it was a great castle! Everything inside it was\n",
      "of silver and gold!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she married him; and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for\n",
      "all the rest of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, let no one say that any one who is silly can never become a\n",
      "person of importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl, who was loved by every\n",
      "one who looked at her, and most of all by her Grandmother. There was\n",
      "nothing that she would not have given the child!\n",
      "\n",
      "Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well\n",
      "that she would not wear anything else. So she was always called Little\n",
      "Red-Cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, her Mother said to her, “Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\n",
      "of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your Grandmother. She is ill\n",
      "and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot. Walk\n",
      "nicely and quietly. Do not run off the path, or you may fall and break\n",
      "the bottle; then your Grandmother will get nothing! When you go into\n",
      "her room, don’t forget to say ‘Good morning,’ and don’t stop to peep\n",
      "into every corner, before you do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll take great care,” said Little Red-Cap to her Mother, and gave her\n",
      "hand on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grandmother lived in the wood, half an hour’s distance from the\n",
      "village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a Wolf met her.\n",
      "Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all\n",
      "afraid of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-day, Little Red-Cap,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you kindly, Wolf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To my Grandmother’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have you got in your apron?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick Grandmother is\n",
      "to have something good, to make her stronger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where does your Grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A good quarter of an hour farther on in the wood. Her house stands\n",
      "under the three large oak-trees; the nut-trees are just below. You\n",
      "surely must know it,” replied Little Red-Cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wolf thought to himself, “What a tender young creature! what a nice\n",
      "plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\n",
      "act craftily, so as to catch both.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he\n",
      "said, “See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why\n",
      "do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly\n",
      "the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were\n",
      "going to school, while everything else in the wood is merry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams\n",
      "dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing\n",
      "everywhere, she thought, “Suppose I take Grandmother a fresh nosegay.\n",
      "That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still\n",
      "get there in good time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And\n",
      "whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier\n",
      "one farther on, and ran after it, and thus got deeper and deeper into\n",
      "the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Wolf ran straight to the Grandmother’s house and knocked\n",
      "at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Little Red-Cap,” replied the Wolf. “She is bringing cake and wine.\n",
      "Open the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lift the latch,” called out the Grandmother, “I am too weak, and\n",
      "cannot get up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a\n",
      "word he went straight to the Grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then\n",
      "he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed,\n",
      "and drew the curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers. When\n",
      "she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered\n",
      "her Grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open. And when she\n",
      "went into the room, she had such a strange feeling, that she said to\n",
      "herself, “Oh dear! how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like\n",
      "being with Grandmother so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She called out, “Good morning,” but received no answer. So she went to\n",
      "the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her Grandmother with her\n",
      "cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Grandmother,” she said, “what big ears you have!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The better to hear you with, my Child,” was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Grandmother, what big eyes you have!” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The better to see you with, my dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Grandmother, what large hands you have!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The better to hug you with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! but Grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The better to eat you with!” And scarcely had the Wolf said this, than\n",
      "with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\n",
      "fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\n",
      "the house, and thought to himself, “How the old woman is snoring! I\n",
      "must just see if she wants anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the Wolf\n",
      "lying in it. “Do I find thee here, thou old sinner!” said he. “I have\n",
      "long sought thee!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the\n",
      "Wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be\n",
      "saved. So he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to\n",
      "cut open the stomach of the sleeping Wolf.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then\n",
      "he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, “Ah,\n",
      "how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the Wolf!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely\n",
      "able to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red-Cap then quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the\n",
      "Wolf’s body. And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones\n",
      "were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the Wolf’s skin\n",
      "and went home with it. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine\n",
      "which Red-Cap had brought, and grew strong again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Red-Cap thought to herself, “As long as I live, I will never leave\n",
      "the path to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A King had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure, but so\n",
      "proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good enough for her. She\n",
      "sent away one after the other, and made fun of them as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the King gave a great feast and invited thereto, from far and\n",
      "near, all the young men likely to marry. They were marshalled in a row\n",
      "according to their rank and standing. First came the Kings, then the\n",
      "Grand-dukes, then the Princes, the Earls, the Barons, and the gentry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King’s Daughter was led through the ranks, but to every one\n",
      "she had some objection to make. One was too fat, “The wine-cask,” she\n",
      "said. Another was too tall, “Long and thin has little in.” The third\n",
      "was too short, “Short and thick is never quick.” The fourth was too\n",
      "pale, “As pale as death.” The fifth too red, “A fighting-cock.” The\n",
      "sixth was not straight enough, “A green log dried behind the stove.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she had something to say against every one. But she made herself\n",
      "especially merry over a good King, who stood quite high up in the row,\n",
      "and whose chin had grown a little crooked. “Well,” she cried and\n",
      "laughed, “he has a chin like a thrush’s beak!” and from that time he\n",
      "got the name of King Thrushbeard.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the old King, when he saw that his daughter did nothing but mock\n",
      "people, and despised all the suitors who were gathered there, was very\n",
      "angry, and swore that she should have for her husband the very first\n",
      "beggar that came to his doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days afterward, a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows,\n",
      "trying to earn a small alms. When the King heard him, he said, “Let him\n",
      "come up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the fiddler came up, in his dirty, ragged clothes, and sang before\n",
      "the King and his daughter. When he had ended he asked for a trifling\n",
      "gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said, “Your song has pleased me so well that I will give you\n",
      "my daughter there, to wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Daughter shuddered, but the King said, “I have taken an oath\n",
      "to give you to the very first beggar man, and I will keep it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All she could say was in vain; the priest was brought, and she had to\n",
      "let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "When that was done the King said, “Now it is not proper for you, a\n",
      "beggar woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may go away with\n",
      "your husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The beggar man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to go away\n",
      "on foot with him. When they came to a large forest she asked, “To whom\n",

      "\n",
      "“It belongs to King Thrushbeard. If you had taken him, it would have\n",

      "\n",
      "“I see that this will not do,” said the man; “you had better spin;\n",
      "perhaps you can do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down and tried to spin, but the hard thread soon cut her soft\n",
      "fingers so that the blood ran down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See,” said the man, “you are fit for no sort of work. I have made a\n",
      "bad bargain with you. Now, I will try to earn a living by selling pots\n",
      "and earthenware. You must sit in the market-place and sell the ware.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas,” thought she, “if any of the people from my father’s kingdom\n",
      "come to the market and see me sitting there, selling, how they will\n",
      "mock me!” But it was of no use, she had to yield unless she chose to\n",
      "die of hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, she succeeded well, for the people were glad to buy\n",
      "the woman’s wares because she was good-looking, and they paid her what\n",
      "she asked. Many even gave her the money and left the pots with her as\n",
      "well. So they lived on what she had earned as long as it lasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the husband bought a lot of new crockery. With this she sat down\n",
      "at the corner of the market-place, and set it around her ready for\n",
      "sale. But suddenly there came a drunken soldier galloping along, and\n",
      "he rode right amongst the pots, so that they were all broken into a\n",
      "thousand bits.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began to weep, and did not know what to do for fear. “Alas! what\n",
      "will happen to me?” cried she; “what will my husband say to this?” She\n",
      "ran home and told him of the misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who would seat herself at a corner of the market-place with crockery?”\n",
      "said the man. “Leave off crying. I see very well that you cannot do\n",
      "ordinary work, so I have been to our King’s palace and have asked\n",
      "whether they cannot find a place for a kitchen-maid. They have promised\n",
      "me to take you. In that way, you will get your food for nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Daughter was now a kitchen-maid, and had to be at the\n",
      "cook’s beck and call, and do the dirtiest work. In each of her pockets\n",
      "she fastened a little jar, in which she took home her share of the\n",
      "leavings, and upon this they lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the wedding of the King’s eldest son was to be\n",
      "celebrated. So the poor woman went up and placed herself by the door of\n",
      "the hall to look on. When all the candles were lit, and people, each\n",
      "more beautiful than the other, entered, and all was full of pomp and\n",
      "splendor, she thought of her lot with a sad heart, and cursed the pride\n",
      "and haughtiness which had humbled her, and brought her to so great\n",
      "poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of the delicious dishes which were being taken in and out\n",
      "reached her, and now and then the servants threw her a few morsels.\n",
      "These she put in her jars to take home.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, the King’s Son entered, clothed in velvet and silk,\n",
      "with gold chains about his neck. And when he saw the beautiful woman\n",
      "standing by the door he seized her by the hand, and would have danced\n",
      "with her. But she refused and shrank back with fear, for she saw that\n",
      "it was King Thrushbeard, her suitor whom she had driven away with scorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her struggles were of no use; he drew her into the hall. But the string\n",
      "by which her pockets were fastened, broke, the pots fell down, the soup\n",
      "ran out, and the scraps were scattered all around. And when the people\n",
      "saw it, there arose laughter and derision, and she was so ashamed that\n",
      "she would rather have been a thousand fathoms below ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sprang to the door and would have run away, but on the stairs a man\n",
      "caught her and brought her back. And when she looked at him it was King\n",
      "Thrushbeard!\n",
      "\n",
      "He said to her kindly, “Do not be afraid, I and the fiddler who has\n",
      "been living with you in that wretched hovel are one. For love of you I\n",
      "disguised myself so. And I, also, was the soldier who rode through your\n",
      "crockery. This was all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish\n",
      "you for the insolence with which you mocked me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she wept bitterly and said, “I have done great wrong, and am not\n",
      "worthy to be your wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he said, “Be comforted. The evil days are past. Now we will\n",
      "celebrate our wedding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the maids-in-waiting came, and put the most splendid clothing on\n",
      "her. Her father and his whole Court arrived, and wished her happiness\n",
      "in her marriage to King Thrushbeard. And the joy now began in earnest.\n",
      "I wish you and I had been there too!\n",

      "There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little\n",
      "cottage. They earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand\n",
      "to mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it came to pass one day, when the man was sitting by the waterside\n",
      "and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak\n",
      "and said, “Hark you, Fisherman, if you will throw me back again into\n",
      "the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the fisherman answered, “Of what use is a castle to me, if I have\n",
      "nothing to eat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gold Fish continued, “That shall be taken care of. There will be a\n",
      "cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of\n",
      "the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you may desire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that be true,” said the man, “then I can well do you a favor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the Fish, “there is, however, the condition that you shall\n",
      "tell no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck\n",
      "has come. If you speak but one single word, all will be over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the man threw the wonderful Fish back again into the water, and\n",
      "went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He opened\n",
      "wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes,\n",
      "sitting in a splendid room.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was quite delighted, and said, “Husband, how has all this come to\n",
      "pass? It suits me very well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the man, “it suits me too. But I am frightfully hungry,\n",
      "just give me something to eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Said the wife, “But I have got nothing and don’t know where to find\n",
      "anything in this new house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no need of your knowing,” said the man, “for I see yonder a\n",
      "great cupboard, just unlock it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she opened it, lo! there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the woman cried joyfully, “What more can you want, my dear?” and\n",
      "they sat down, and ate and drank together.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had had enough, the woman said, “But, Husband, whence come\n",
      "all these riches?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas,” answered he, “do not question me about it, for I dare not tell\n",
      "you anything. If I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune\n",
      "will fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very good,” said she, “if I am not to know anything, then I do not\n",
      "want to know anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she was not in earnest. She never rested day or night, and she\n",
      "goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was\n",
      "owing to a wonderful Gold Fish which he had caught, and to which in\n",
      "return he had given its liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the\n",
      "cupboard immediately disappeared. They were once more in the old\n",
      "fisherman’s hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and\n",
      "fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the Gold Fish.\n",
      "“Listen,” said the Fish, “if you will throw me back into the water\n",
      "again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of\n",
      "roast and boiled meats. Only be firm; for your life’s sake don’t reveal\n",
      "from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will take good care,” answered the fisherman, and threw the fish\n",
      "back into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at home, everything was once more in its former magnificence. The\n",
      "wife was overjoyed at their good fortune. But curiosity left her no\n",
      "peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had\n",
      "come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so\n",
      "angry that he broke out and betrayed the secret. In an instant the\n",
      "castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you have got what you want,” said he; “and we can gnaw at a bare\n",
      "bone again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said the woman, “I had rather have no riches; if I am not to know\n",
      "from whom they come, then I have no peace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the\n",
      "Gold Fish for a third time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen,” said the Fish, “I see very well that I am fated to fall into\n",
      "your hands. Take me home and cut me into six pieces. Give your wife two\n",
      "of them to eat, two to your horse, and bury two of them in the ground.\n",
      "Then they will bring you a blessing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fisherman took the Fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass that from the two pieces that were buried in the\n",
      "ground, two Golden Lilies sprang up; that the horse had two Golden\n",
      "Foals; and the fisherman’s wife bore two children who were made\n",
      "entirely of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and\n",
      "horses grew likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the lads said, “Father, we want to mount our Golden Steeds and\n",
      "travel out in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he answered sorrowfully, “How shall I bear it, if you go away and I\n",
      "know not how it fares with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they said, “The two Golden Lilies remain here. By them you may see\n",
      "how it is with us. If they are fresh, then we are in health. If they\n",
      "are withered, we are ill. If they perish, then we are dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people. They\n",
      "perceived the Gold-Children and began to laugh, and jeer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out\n",
      "into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father. But\n",
      "the other rode forward and reached a great forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was about to enter it, the people said, “It is not safe for\n",
      "you to ride through; the wood is full of robbers, who would treat you\n",
      "badly. You will fare ill. When they see that you are all of gold and\n",
      "your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, “I must and\n",
      "will ride through it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so\n",
      "that the gold was not seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest. When\n",
      "he had ridden onward a little, he heard a rustling in the bushes, and\n",
      "heard voices speaking together.\n",
      "\n",
      "From one side came cries of, “There is one!” but from the other, “Let\n",
      "him go! ’tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse. What\n",
      "should we gain from him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Gold-Child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so\n",
      "beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she\n",
      "existed in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and\n",
      "said, “I love you with my whole heart. Will you be my wife?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said, “Yes, I\n",
      "will be your wife, and be true to you your whole life long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were married. Then just as they were in the greatest happiness,\n",
      "home came the father of the Bride. When he saw that his daughter’s\n",
      "wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said, “Where is\n",
      "the Bridegroom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They showed him the Gold-Child, who, however, still wore his bear-skins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the father said wrathfully, “A vagabond shall never have my\n",
      "daughter!” and was about to kill him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Bride begged as hard as she could, and said, “He is my\n",
      "husband, and I love him with all my heart!” until at last he allowed\n",
      "himself to be appeased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he\n",
      "rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter’s husband was a common\n",
      "ragged beggar. But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man\n",
      "in the bed, and the cast-off bear-skins lying on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went back, and thought, “What a good thing it was that I\n",
      "restrained my anger! I should have committed a great crime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Gold-Child dreamed that he rode out to the chase of a splendid\n",
      "stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, “I must go\n",
      "out hunting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, “You might\n",
      "easily meet with a great misfortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he answered, “I must and will go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest. It was not long\n",
      "before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream. He\n",
      "aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away. He gave chase\n",
      "over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired. In\n",
      "the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the Gold-Child\n",
      "looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a\n",
      "Witch.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked, “What are you\n",
      "doing so late in the midst of the great forest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you not seen a stag?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered she, “I know the stag well,” and thereupon a little dog\n",
      "which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you be silent, you odious toad,” said he, “or I will shoot you\n",
      "dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Witch cried out in a passion, “What! will you slay my little\n",
      "dog?” and immediately she transformed him, so that he lay like a stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile his Bride awaited him in vain, and thought, “That which I so\n",
      "greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But at home, the other brother was standing by the Gold-Lilies, when\n",
      "one of them suddenly drooped. “Alas!” said he, “my brother has met with\n",
      "some great misfortune! I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he mounted his Golden Horse, and rode forth and entered the great\n",
      "forest, where his brother lay turned to stone. The old Witch came out\n",
      "of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not go near her, but said, “I will shoot you, if you do not\n",
      "bring my brother to life again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger.\n",
      "Then he was immediately restored to his human shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Gold-Children rejoiced, when they saw each other again. They\n",
      "kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the\n",
      "forest, the one home to his Bride, the other to his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father then said, “I knew well that you had rescued your brother,\n",
      "for the Golden Lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time, in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\n",
      "falling like feathers from the sky, a Queen sat at a window sewing, and\n",
      "the frame of the window was made of black ebony.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow,\n",
      "she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell\n",
      "upon the snow. And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she\n",
      "thought to herself, “Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red\n",
      "as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow,\n",
      "and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony. She was\n",
      "therefore called little Snow-White. And when the child was born, the\n",
      "Queen died.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife. She\n",
      "was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear\n",
      "that any one else should surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful\n",
      "looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself\n",
      "in it, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "the Looking-Glass answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the Looking-Glass spoke the\n",
      "truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But little Snow-White was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful.\n",
      "When she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more\n",
      "beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the Queen asked her\n",
      "Looking-Glass:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "it answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen.\n",
      "      But more beautiful still is Snow-White, I ween._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy. From\n",
      "that hour, whenever she looked at little Snow-White, her heart heaved\n",
      "in her breast, she hated the maiden so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so\n",
      "that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said,\n",
      "“Take the child away into the forest. I will no longer have her in my\n",
      "sight. Kill her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman obeyed, and took her away. But when he had drawn his\n",
      "knife, and was about to pierce little Snow-White’s innocent heart, she\n",
      "began to weep, and said, “Ah, dear Huntsman, leave me my life! I will\n",
      "run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And as she was so beautiful, the huntsman had pity on her and said,\n",
      "“Run away, then, you poor child.” “The wild beasts will soon have\n",
      "devoured you,” thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been\n",
      "rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so\n",
      "terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not\n",
      "know what to do. Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and\n",
      "through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "She ran as long as her feet would go, until it was almost evening. Then\n",
      "she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. Everything\n",
      "in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told.\n",
      "There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates,\n",
      "and on each plate a little spoon. Moreover, there were seven little\n",
      "knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven\n",
      "little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snow-White was so hungry and thirsty, that she ate some\n",
      "vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of\n",
      "each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only. Then, as she\n",
      "was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none\n",
      "of them suited her. One was too long, another too short, but at last\n",
      "she found that the seventh one was right, so she remained in it, said a\n",
      "prayer and went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back. They were\n",
      "seven Dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore. They lit\n",
      "their seven candles, and, as it was now light within the cottage, they\n",
      "saw that some one had been there, for everything was not in the same\n",
      "order in which they had left it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first said, “Who has been sitting on my chair?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second, “Who has been eating off my plate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The third, “Who has been taking some of my bread?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth, “Who has been eating my vegetables?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth, “Who has been using my fork?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sixth, “Who has been cutting with my knife?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The seventh, “Who has been drinking out of my mug?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his\n",
      "bed, and he said, “Who has been getting into my bed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The others came up and each called out, “Somebody has been lying in my\n",
      "bed too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-White, who\n",
      "was lying fast asleep therein. And he called the others, who came\n",
      "running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their\n",
      "seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow-White.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, oh!” cried they, “what a lovely child!” and they were so glad that\n",
      "they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed. And the\n",
      "seventh Dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got\n",
      "through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, little Snow-White awoke, and was frightened when she\n",
      "saw the seven Dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her\n",
      "name was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is little Snow-White,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How have you come to our house?” said the Dwarfs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told them that the wicked Queen had wished to have her\n",
      "killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run\n",
      "for the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dwarfs said, “If you will take care of our house, cook, make the\n",
      "beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and\n",
      "clean, you may stay with us and you shall want for nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said little Snow-White, “with all my heart,” and she stayed with\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kept the house in order for them. In the mornings they went to the\n",
      "mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came\n",
      "back, and then their supper had to be ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden was alone the whole day, so the good Dwarfs warned her and\n",
      "said, “Beware of the Queen, she will soon know that you are here. Be\n",
      "sure to let no one come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Queen, believing that little Snow-White was dead, could not but\n",
      "think that she herself was again the first and most beautiful of all.\n",
      "She went to her Looking-Glass, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and the Glass answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n",
      "      But over the hills, where the Seven Dwarfs dwell,\n",
      "      Little Snow-White is alive and well,\n",
      "      And none is so fair as she._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she was astounded, for she knew that the Looking-Glass never spoke\n",
      "falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, for that\n",
      "little Snow-White was still alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so\n",
      "long as she herself was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her\n",
      "have no rest. And when she had at last thought of something to do, she\n",
      "painted her face, and dressed herself like an old pedler-woman, and no\n",
      "one could have known her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this disguise she went over the Seven Mountains to the Seven Dwarfs,\n",
      "and knocked at the door and cried, “Pretty things to sell, very cheap,\n",
      "very cheap!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snow-White looked out at the window, and called, “Good-day, my\n",
      "dear woman, what have you to sell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good things, pretty things,” she answered; “stay-laces of all colors,”\n",
      "and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I may let the worthy old woman in,” thought little Snow-White, and she\n",
      "unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Child,” said the old woman, “what a fright you look. Come, I will lace\n",
      "you properly for once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snow-White had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let\n",
      "herself be laced with the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly\n",
      "and laced so tightly that little Snow-White lost her breath and fell\n",
      "down as if dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I am the most beautiful,” said the Queen to herself, and ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long afterward, in the evening, the Seven Dwarfs came home. But\n",
      "how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snow-White lying\n",
      "on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to\n",
      "be dead. They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too\n",
      "tightly, they cut the laces. Than she began to breathe a little, and\n",
      "after a while came to life again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Dwarfs heard what had happened, they said, “The old\n",
      "pedler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen. Take care and let\n",
      "no one come in when we are not with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wicked woman, when she had reached home, went in front of the\n",
      "Glass and asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",

      "      And none is so fair as she._”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for\n",
      "she saw plainly that little Snow-White was again alive. “But now,” she\n",
      "said, “I will think of something that shall put an end to you,” and by\n",
      "the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she disguised herself, and took the shape of another old woman. So\n",
      "she went over the Seven Mountains to the Seven Dwarfs, knocked at the\n",
      "door, and cried, “Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snow-White looked out, and said, “Go away. I cannot let any one\n",
      "come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose you may look,” said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous\n",
      "comb out and held it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It pleased the maiden so well that she let herself be beguiled, and\n",
      "opened the door. When they had made a bargain, the old woman said, “Now\n",
      "I will comb you properly for once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor little Snow-White had no suspicion, and let the Old Woman do as\n",
      "she pleased. But hardly had she put the comb in her hair, then the\n",
      "poison in it took effect, and the maiden fell down senseless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You paragon of beauty,” said the wicked woman, “you are done for now!”\n",
      "and she went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But fortunately it was almost evening, and the Seven Dwarfs came home.\n",
      "When they saw little Snow-White lying as if dead upon the ground, they\n",
      "at once suspected the Queen. They looked and found the poisoned comb.\n",
      "Scarcely had they taken it out, when little Snow-White came to herself,\n",
      "and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be\n",
      "upon her guard, and to open the door to no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen, at home, went in front of the Glass and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",

      "      And none is so fair as she._”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she heard the Glass speak thus, she trembled and shook with rage.\n",
      "“Little Snow-White shall die,” she cried, “even if it costs me my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon she went into a secret, lonely room, where no one ever came,\n",
      "and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty,\n",
      "white with a red cheek, so that every one who saw it longed for it.\n",
      "But whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the apple was ready, she painted her face, and dressed herself as\n",
      "a countrywoman, and so she went over the Seven Mountains to the Seven\n",
      "Dwarfs. She knocked at the door. Little Snow-White put her head out of\n",
      "the window and said, “I cannot let any one in. The Seven Dwarfs have\n",
      "forbidden me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all the same to me,” answered the woman, “I shall soon get rid\n",
      "of my apples. There, I will give you one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said little Snow-White, “I dare not take anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you afraid of poison?” said the old woman. “Look, I will cut the\n",
      "apple in two pieces. You eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.\n",
      "Little Snow-White longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the\n",
      "woman ate part of it, she could resist no longer, and stretched out her\n",
      "hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her\n",
      "mouth, than she fell down dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud,\n",
      "and said, “White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood! This time\n",
      "the Dwarfs cannot wake you up again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when she asked of the Looking-Glass at home:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "it answered at last:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found little Snow-White\n",
      "lying upon the ground. She breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted\n",
      "her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous,\n",
      "unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it\n",
      "was all of no use. The poor child was dead, and remained dead. They\n",
      "laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for\n",
      "her, and wept three days long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she was\n",
      "living, and still had her pretty red cheeks. They said, “We could not\n",
      "bury her in the dark ground,” and they had a transparent coffin of\n",
      "glass made, so that she might be seen from all sides. They laid her in\n",
      "it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a\n",
      "King’s Daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always\n",
      "stayed by it to watch it. And birds came too, and wept for little\n",
      "Snow-White; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now little Snow-White lay a long, long time in the coffin. She did\n",
      "not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as\n",
      "snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened, however, that a King’s Son came into the forest, and went\n",
      "to the Dwarfs’ house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the\n",
      "mountain, and the beautiful little Snow-White within it, and read what\n",
      "was written upon it in golden letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said to the Dwarfs, “Let me have the coffin. I will give you\n",
      "whatever you want for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Dwarfs answered, “We will not part with it for all the gold in\n",
      "the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said, “Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without\n",
      "seeing little Snow-White. I will honor and prize her as my dearest\n",
      "possession,” As he spoke in this way the good Dwarfs took pity upon\n",
      "him, and gave him the coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the King’s Son had it carried away by his servants on their\n",
      "shoulders. And it happened, that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and\n",
      "with the shock the poisonous piece of apple, which little Snow-White\n",
      "had bitten off, came out of her throat. And before long she opened her\n",
      "eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, where am I?” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son, full of joy, said, “You are with me,” and told her what\n",
      "had happened, and said, “I love you more than everything in the world.\n",
      "Come with me to my father’s palace, you shall be my wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And little Snow-White was willing, and went with him, and their wedding\n",
      "was held with great show and splendor. But the wicked Queen was also\n",
      "bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes,\n",
      "she went before the Looking-Glass, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,\n",
      "      Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "the Glass answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest art thou,\n",
      "      But the young Queen is fairer by far, I trow!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly\n",
      "wretched, that she knew not what to do. At first she would not go to\n",
      "the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young\n",
      "Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when she went in she knew little Snow-White. And she stood still\n",
      "with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already\n",
      "been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set\n",
      "before her. Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance\n",
      "until she dropped down dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter.\n",
      "Now it happened that he had to speak to the King, and in order to make\n",
      "himself appear important he said to him, “I have a daughter who can\n",
      "spin straw into gold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said to the miller, “That is an art which pleases me well.\n",
      "If your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my\n",
      "palace, and I will try what she can do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the girl was brought to him, he took her into a room which was\n",
      "quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said,\n",
      "“Now set to work. If by to-morrow morning early, you have not spun this\n",
      "straw into gold, you must die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone. So\n",
      "there sat the poor miller’s daughter, and for her life could not tell\n",
      "what to do. She had no idea how straw could be spun into gold; and she\n",
      "grew more and more miserable, until at last she began to weep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all at once the door opened, and in came a Little Man, and said,\n",
      "“Good evening, Mistress Miller. Why are you crying so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas!” answered the girl, “I have to spin straw into gold, and I do\n",
      "not know how to do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What will you give me,” said the Little Man, “if I do it for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My necklace,” said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Little Man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel,\n",
      "and _whirr, whirr, whirr,_ three turns, and the reel was full. Then he\n",
      "put another on, and _whirr, whirr, whirr,_ three times round, and the\n",
      "second was full too. And so it went on till the morning, when all the\n",
      "straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "By daybreak, the King was there, and when he saw the gold, he was\n",
      "astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy. He had\n",
      "the miller’s daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was\n",
      "much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she\n",
      "valued her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door\n",
      "again opened, and the Little Man appeared, and said, “What will you\n",
      "give me if I spin the straw into gold for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ring on my finger,” answered the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Little Man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and, by\n",
      "morning, had spun all the straw into glittering gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not\n",
      "gold enough. He had the miller’s daughter taken into a still larger\n",
      "room full of straw, and said, “You must spin this, too, in the course\n",
      "of this night. But if you succeed, you shall be my wife.” “Even if she\n",
      "be a miller’s daughter,” thought he, “I could not find a richer wife in\n",
      "the whole world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girl was alone the Little Man came again for the third time,\n",

      "\n",

      "find out my name, then you shall keep your child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had ever\n",

      "_Sheepshanks_, or _Laceleg_?” but he always answered, “That is not my\n",

      "good night, there I saw a little house. Before the house a fire was\n",

      "acquaintance, but also the Wise Women, in order that they might be kind\n",
      "and well-disposed toward the child. There were thirteen of them in his\n",

      "\n",
      "The feast was held with all manner of splendor. When it came to an\n",

      "the world that one can wish for.\n",
      "\n",
      "When eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the thirteenth\n",
      "came in. She wished to avenge herself for not having been invited, and\n",
      "without greeting, or even looking at any one, she cried with a loud\n",
      "voice, “The King’s Daughter, in her fifteenth year, shall prick herself\n",
      "with a spindle, and fall down dead.” And, without saying a word more,\n",
      "she turned round and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all shocked. But the twelfth, whose good wish still remained\n",
      "unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo the evil sentence,\n",
      "but only soften it, she said, “It shall not be death, but a deep sleep\n",
      "of a hundred years, into which the Princess shall fall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King, who wished to keep his dear child from the misfortune,\n",

      "\n",
      "It happened that on the very day, when she was fifteen years old,\n",
      "the King and Queen were not at home, and the maiden was left in the\n",
      "palace quite alone. So she went round into all sorts of places, looked\n",
      "into rooms and bedchambers just as she liked, and at last came to an\n",
      "old tower. She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase, and reached\n",
      "a little door. A rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it\n",
      "the door sprang open. There in a little room sat an Old Woman with a\n",
      "spindle, busily spinning flax.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, old Dame,” said the King’s Daughter; “what are you doing\n",

      "\n",
      "“What sort of thing is that, which rattles round so merrily?” said the\n",
      "maiden, and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too. But scarcely\n",
      "had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and\n",
      "she pricked her finger with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the\n",
      "bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep. And this sleep extended\n",
      "over the whole palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King and Queen, who had just come home, and had entered the great\n",
      "hall, began to go to sleep, and the whole of the Court with them. The\n",
      "horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in the yard, the\n",
      "pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall. Even the fire, that was\n",
      "flaming on the hearth, became quiet and slept. The roast meat left off\n",
      "frizzling, and the cook, who was just going to pull the hair of the\n",
      "scullery boy, because he had forgotten something, let him go, and went\n",
      "to sleep. And the wind fell; and on the trees before the castle not a\n",
      "leaf moved again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But round about the castle, there began to grow a hedge of thorns.\n",
      "Every year it became higher, and at last grew close up round the castle\n",
      "and all over it, so that there was nothing of it to be seen, not even\n",
      "the flag upon the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the story of the beautiful sleeping “Briar-Rose,” for so the\n",
      "Princess was named, went about the country, so that from time to time\n",
      "Kings’ Sons came and tried to get through the thorny hedge into\n",
      "the castle. But they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast\n",
      "together, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught in them,\n",
      "could not get loose again, and died a miserable death.\n",
      "\n",
      "After long, long years, again a King’s Son came to that country. He\n",
      "heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge, and that a castle was\n",
      "said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful Princess,\n",
      "named Briar-Rose, had been asleep for a hundred years; and that the\n",
      "King and Queen and the whole Court were asleep likewise. He had heard,\n",
      "too, from his grandfather, that many Kings’ Sons had come, and had\n",
      "tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had remained sticking\n",
      "fast in it, so had died a pitiful death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the youth said, “I am not afraid. I will go and see the beautiful\n",
      "Briar-Rose.” The good old man might dissuade him as he would, he did\n",
      "not listen to his words.\n",
      "\n",
      "But by this time the hundred years had just passed. The day was come\n",
      "when Briar-Rose was to awake again. When the King’s Son came near to\n",
      "the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but large and beautiful flowers, which\n",
      "parted from each other of their own accord, and let him pass unhurt.\n",
      "Then they closed again behind him like a hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the castle-yard he saw the horses and the spotted hounds lying\n",
      "asleep. On the roof, sat the pigeons with their heads under their\n",
      "wings. And when he entered the house, the flies were asleep upon the\n",
      "wall, the cook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize\n",
      "the boy, and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she was going\n",
      "to pluck.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of the\n",
      "Court lying asleep, and by the throne lay the King and Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath could\n",
      "be heard. At last he came to the tower, and opened the door into the\n",
      "little room where Briar-Rose was sleeping. There she lay, so beautiful\n",
      "that he could not turn his eyes away. He stooped down and gave her a\n",
      "kiss. But as soon as he kissed her, Briar-Rose opened her eyes and\n",
      "awoke, and looked at him quite sweetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went down together, and the King awoke, and the Queen, and\n",
      "the whole Court, and gazed at each other in great astonishment. And\n",
      "the horses in the courtyard stood up and shook themselves. The hounds\n",
      "jumped up and wagged their tails. The pigeons upon the roof pulled\n",
      "out their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into\n",
      "the open country. The flies on the wall crept again. The fire in the\n",
      "kitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat. The joint began to\n",
      "turn and frizzle, and the cook gave the boy such a box on the ear that\n",
      "he screamed, and the maid plucked the fowl ready for the spit.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the marriage of the King’s Son and Briar-Rose was celebrated\n",
      "with all splendor, and they lived contented to the end of their days.\n",

      "\n",
      "The girls were acquainted with each other. They went walking together,\n",
      "and came to the woman’s house. Then she said to the man’s daughter:\n",

      "“Listen! Tell your father that I would like to marry him. Then you\n",

      "\n",

      "man said, “What shall I do? Marriage is a joy, also a torment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, as he could not decide, he pulled off his boot, and said,\n",
      "“Take this boot. It has a hole in the sole of it. Go with it upstairs\n",
      "to the loft. Hang it on the big nail. Then pour water into it. If it\n",
      "holds the water, then I will again take a wife. But if it runs through,\n",
      "I will not!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl did as she was ordered, but the water drew the hole together,\n",
      "and the boot became full to the top. She informed her father how it had\n",
      "turned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he himself went up, and when he saw that she was right, he went to\n",
      "the widow and wooed her, and the wedding was celebrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the\n",
      "man’s daughter, milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink. But\n",
      "before the woman’s daughter, stood water to wash herself with and water\n",
      "for drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second morning, stood water for washing and water for drinking\n",
      "before the man’s daughter as well as before the woman’s daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on the third morning, stood water for washing and water for\n",
      "drinking before the man’s daughter, and milk for washing and wine for\n",
      "drinking, before the woman’s daughter, and so it continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman became bitterly unkind to the man’s daughter, and day by day\n",
      "did her best to treat her still worse. She was envious too because the\n",
      "man’s daughter was beautiful and lovable, and her own daughter ugly and\n",
      "repulsive.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone, and\n",
      "hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock of paper,\n",
      "called the man’s daughter and said, “Here, put on this dress and go out\n",
      "into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of strawberries,--I have\n",
      "a fancy for some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas!” said the girl, “no strawberries grow in winter! The ground is\n",
      "frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything. And why am I to\n",
      "go in this paper frock? It is so cold outside that one’s very breath\n",
      "freezes! The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns will tear\n",
      "it off my body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you contradict me again?” said the woman. “See that you go,\n",
      "and do not show your face again until you have the basketful of\n",
      "strawberries!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, “This will\n",
      "last you the day,” and thought, “You will die of cold and hunger\n",
      "outside, and will never be seen again by me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the girl obeyed, and put on the paper frock, and went out with the\n",
      "basket. Far and wide there was nothing but snow, and not a green blade\n",
      "to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped\n",
      "three little Dwarfs. She wished them good day, and knocked modestly at\n",
      "the door. They cried, “Come in,” and she entered the room and seated\n",
      "herself on the bench by the stove, where she began to warm herself and\n",
      "eat her breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dwarfs said, “Give us some of it.”\n",

      "“Willingly,” said she, and divided her bit of bread in two, and gave\n",
      "them the half.\n",
      "\n",
      "They asked, “What do you here in the forest in the winter time, in your\n",
      "thin dress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” she answered, “I am to look for a basketful of strawberries, and\n",
      "am not to go home until I can take them with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had eaten her bread, they gave her a broom and said, “Sweep\n",
      "away the snow at the back door with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she was outside, the three Little Men said to one another,\n",
      "“What shall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread\n",
      "with us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the first, “My gift is, that every day she shall grow more\n",
      "beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second said, “My gift is, that gold pieces shall fall out of her\n",
      "mouth every time she speaks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The third said, “My gift is, that a King shall come and take her to\n",
      "wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl, however, did as the Little Men had bidden her, swept away the\n",
      "snow behind the little house with the broom. And what did she find but\n",
      "real ripe strawberries, which came up quite dark-red out of the snow!\n",
      "In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the Little\n",
      "Men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take the woman what\n",
      "she had longed for so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once fell\n",
      "out of her mouth. Thereupon she related what had happened to her in the\n",
      "wood. But with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell from her mouth,\n",
      "until very soon the whole room was covered with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now look at her pride,” cried the woman’s daughter, “to throw about\n",
      "gold in that way!” but she was secretly envious of it, and wanted to go\n",
      "into the forest to seek strawberries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother said, “No, my dear little Daughter, it is too cold, you\n",
      "might die of cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as her daughter let her have no peace, the mother at last\n",
      "yielded, made her a magnificent dress of fur, which she was obliged to\n",
      "put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake to take with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house. The\n",
      "three Little Men peeped out again, but she did not greet them. Without\n",
      "looking round at them and without speaking to them, she went awkwardly\n",
      "into the room, seated herself by the stove, and began to eat her\n",
      "bread-and-butter and cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give us some of it,” cried the Little Men.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she replied, “There is not enough for myself, so how can I give it\n",
      "away to other people?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had done eating, they said, “There is a broom for you, sweep\n",
      "all clean for us outside by the back-door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! Sweep for yourselves,” she answered, “I am not your servant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she saw that they were not going to give her anything, she went\n",
      "out the door. Then the Little Men said to each other, “What shall we\n",
      "give her as she is so naughty, and has a wicked envious heart, that\n",
      "will never let her do a good turn to any one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first said, “I grant that she may grow uglier every day.”\n",
      "\n",

      "her mother what had happened to her in the wood, with each word she\n",
      "said, a toad sprang out of her mouth, so that everybody was seized with\n",
      "horror of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but\n",
      "how to do every possible injury to the man’s daughter, whose beauty,\n",
      "however, grew daily greater. At length she took a cauldron, set it on\n",
      "the fire, and boiled yarn in it. When it was boiled, she flung it on\n",
      "the poor girl’s shoulder, and gave her an axe in order that she might\n",
      "go on the frozen river, cut a hole in the ice, and rinse the yarn.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was obedient, went thither and cut a hole in the ice. And while she\n",
      "was in the midst of her cutting, a splendid carriage came driving up,\n",
      "in which sat the King. The carriage stopped, and the King asked, “My\n",

      "Then the King felt compassion, and when he saw that she was so very\n",
      "beautiful, he said to her, “Will you go away with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, yes, with all my heart,” she answered, for she was glad to get\n",
      "away from the mother and sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she got into the carriage and drove away with the King, and when\n",
      "they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with great pomp,\n",
      "as the Little Men had granted to the maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the olden time, there was a King, who had behind his palace a\n",
      "beautiful pleasure-garden, in which there was a tree that bore Golden\n",
      "Apples. When the apples were getting ripe they were counted, but on the\n",
      "very next morning one was missing. This was told to the King, and he\n",
      "ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King had three sons, the eldest of whom he sent, as soon as night\n",
      "came, into the garden. But when it was midnight, he could not keep\n",
      "himself from sleeping, and next morning again an apple was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following night, the second son had to keep watch, it fared no\n",
      "better with him. As soon as twelve o’clock had struck he fell asleep,\n",
      "and in the morning an apple was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it came to the turn of the third son to watch. He was quite ready,\n",
      "but the King had not much trust in him, and thought that he would be of\n",
      "less use than his brothers. But at last he let him go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth lay down beneath the tree, but kept awake, and did not let\n",
      "sleep master him. When it struck twelve, something rustled through\n",
      "the air, and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose feathers were\n",
      "shining with gold. The bird alighted on the tree, and had just plucked\n",
      "off an apple, when the youth shot an arrow at him. The bird flew off,\n",
      "but the arrow had struck his plumage, and one of his golden feathers\n",
      "fell down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth picked it up, and the next morning took it to the King and\n",
      "told him what he had seen in the night. The King called his council\n",
      "together, and every one declared that a feather like this was worth\n",
      "more than the whole kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the feather is so precious,” declared the King, “one alone will not\n",
      "do for me. I must and will have the whole bird!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The eldest son set out. He trusted to his cleverness, and thought that\n",
      "he would easily find the Golden Bird. When he had gone some distance he\n",
      "saw a Fox sitting at the edge of a wood, so he cocked his gun and took\n",
      "aim at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fox cried, “Do not shoot me! And in return I will give you some\n",
      "good counsel. You are on the way to the Golden Bird. This evening you\n",
      "will come to a village in which stand two inns opposite to one another.\n",
      "One of them is lighted up brightly, and all goes on merrily within, but\n",
      "do not enter it. Go rather into the other, even though it seems a bad\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can such a silly beast give wise advice?” thought the King’s Son,\n",
      "and he pulled the trigger. But he missed the Fox, who stretched out his\n",
      "tail and ran quickly into the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he pursued his way, and by evening came to the village where the two\n",
      "inns were. In one they were singing and dancing. The other had a poor,\n",
      "miserable look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should be a fool, indeed,” he thought, “if I were to go into the\n",
      "shabby tavern, and pass by the good one.” So he went into the cheerful\n",
      "one, lived there in riot and revel, and forgot the bird and his father,\n",
      "and all good counsels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time had passed, and when the eldest son, month after month,\n",
      "did not come home, the second set out, wishing to find the Golden\n",
      "Bird. The Fox met him as he had met the eldest, and gave him the good\n",
      "advice, of which he took no heed. He came to the two inns. His brother\n",
      "was standing at the window of the one from which came the music, and\n",
      "called to him. He could not resist, but went inside, and lived only for\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again some time passed, and then the youngest King’s Son wanted to set\n",
      "off and try his luck. But his father would not allow it. “It is of no\n",
      "use,” said he, “he will be less likely to find the Golden Bird than his\n",
      "brothers. And if a mishap were to befall him, he knows not how to help\n",
      "himself. He is a little wanting at the best.” But at last, as he had no\n",
      "peace, he let him go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the Fox was sitting outside the wood, and begged for his life,\n",
      "and offered his good advice. The youth was good-natured, and said, “Be\n",
      "easy, little Fox, I will do you no harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall not repent it,” answered the Fox; “and that you may proceed\n",
      "more quickly, get up behind on my tail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And scarcely had he seated himself, when the Fox began to run, and\n",
      "away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in the wind.\n",
      "When they came to the village, the youth got off. He followed the good\n",
      "advice, and without looking round turned into the little inn, where he\n",
      "spent the night quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, as soon as he got into the open country, there sat\n",
      "the Fox already, and said, “I will tell you further what you have to\n",
      "do. Go straight forward. At last you will come to a castle, in front\n",
      "of which a whole regiment of soldiers is lying, but do not trouble\n",
      "yourself about them, for they will all be asleep and snoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go through the midst of them straight into the castle. Go through all\n",
      "the rooms, till at last you will come to a chamber where a Golden Bird\n",
      "is hanging in a wooden cage. Close by, there stands an empty gold cage\n",
      "for show. Beware of taking the bird out of the common cage and putting\n",
      "it into the fine one, or it may go badly with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words the Fox again stretched out his tail, and the King’s\n",
      "Son seated himself upon it. Away he went over stock and stone, till his\n",
      "hair whistled in the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the castle he found everything as the Fox had said. The\n",
      "King’s Son went into the chamber where the Golden Bird was shut up in\n",
      "a wooden cage, whilst a golden one stood hard by; and the three Golden\n",
      "Apples lay about the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But,” thought he, “it would be absurd if I were to leave the beautiful\n",
      "bird in the common and ugly cage,” so he opened the door, laid hold of\n",
      "it, and put it into the golden cage. But at the same moment the bird\n",
      "uttered a shrill cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldiers awoke, rushed in, and took him off to prison. The next\n",
      "morning he was taken before a court of justice, and as he confessed\n",
      "everything, was sentenced to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King, however, said that he would grant him his life on one\n",
      "condition--namely, if he brought him the Golden Horse which ran faster\n",
      "than the wind. And in that case he should receive, over and above, as a\n",
      "reward, the Golden Bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son set off, but he sighed and was sorrowful, for how was he\n",
      "to find the Golden Horse? But all at once he saw his old friend the Fox\n",
      "sitting on the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look you,” said the Fox, “this has happened because you did not give\n",
      "heed to me. However, be of good courage. I will help you, and tell you\n",
      "how to get to the Golden Horse. You must go straight on, and you will\n",
      "come to a castle, where in the stable stands the horse. The grooms will\n",
      "be lying in front of the stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They will be asleep and snoring, and you can quietly lead out the\n",
      "Golden Horse. But of one thing you must take heed. Put on him the\n",
      "common saddle of wood and leather, and not the golden one, which hangs\n",
      "close by, else it will go ill with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Fox stretched out his tail, the King’s Son seated himself upon\n",
      "it. Away he went over stock and stone, until his hair whistled in the\n",
      "wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything happened just as the Fox had said. The King’s Son came to\n",
      "the stable in which the Golden Horse was standing, but just as he was\n",
      "going to put the common saddle upon him, he thought, “It will be a\n",
      "shame to such a beautiful beast, if I do not give him the good saddle\n",
      "which belongs to him by right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But scarcely had the golden saddle touched the horse than he began to\n",
      "neigh loudly. The grooms awoke, seized the youth, and threw him into\n",
      "prison. The next morning he was sentenced by the court to death; but\n",
      "the King promised to grant him his life, and the Golden Horse as well,\n",
      "if he would rescue the beautiful Princess from the Golden Castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a heavy heart the youth set out. Yet luckily for him he soon found\n",
      "the trusty Fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ought to leave you to your ill-luck,” said the Fox, “but I pity you,\n",
      "and will help you once more out of your trouble. This road takes you\n",
      "straight to the Golden Castle. You will reach it by eventide. And at\n",
      "night, when everything is quiet, the beautiful Princess goes to the\n",
      "bathing-house to bathe. When she enters it, run up to her and give her\n",
      "a kiss. Then she will follow you, and you can take her away with you.\n",
      "Only do not allow her to say farewell to her parents first, or it will\n",
      "go ill with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Fox stretched out his tail, the King’s Son seated himself upon\n",
      "it. Away the Fox went, over stock and stone, till his hair whistled in\n",
      "the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the Golden Castle it was just as the Fox had said.\n",
      "He waited until midnight, when everything lay in deep sleep, and the\n",
      "beautiful Princess was going to the bathing-house. Then he sprang out\n",
      "and gave her a kiss. She said that she would like to go with him, but\n",
      "she asked him pitifully, and with tears, to be allowed to take leave of\n",
      "her parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he withstood her prayer, but when she wept more and more, and\n",
      "fell at his feet, he at last gave in. But no sooner had the maiden\n",
      "reached the bedside of her father, than he and all the rest in the\n",
      "castle awoke, and the youth was laid hold of and put into prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the King said to him, “Your life is forfeited, and\n",
      "you can only find mercy if you take away the hill which stands in\n",
      "front of my windows, and prevents my seeing beyond it. And you must\n",
      "finish it all within eight days. If you do that you shall have my\n",
      "daughter as your reward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son began, and dug and shovelled without leaving off. But\n",
      "after seven days when he saw how little he had done, and how all his\n",
      "work was as good as nothing, he fell into great sorrow and gave up all\n",
      "hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the evening of the seventh day the Fox appeared and said, “You do\n",
      "not deserve that I should take any trouble about you. Nevertheless, go\n",
      "away and lie down to sleep. I will do the work for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, when he awoke and looked out of the window, the hill\n",
      "had gone. Full of joy, the youth ran to the King, and told him that the\n",
      "task was fulfilled. And whether he liked it or not, the King had to\n",
      "hold to his word and give him his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the two set forth together, and it was not long before the trusty\n",
      "Fox came up with them. “You have certainly got what is best,” said he,\n",
      "“but the Golden Horse also belongs to the maiden of the Golden Castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How shall I get it?” asked the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I will tell you,” answered the Fox; “first take the beautiful\n",
      "maiden to the King who sent you to the Golden Castle. There will be\n",
      "unheard-of rejoicing. They will gladly give you the Golden Horse, and\n",
      "will bring it out to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All was brought to pass successfully, and the King’s Son carried off\n",
      "the beautiful Princess on the Golden Horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fox did not remain behind, and he said to the youth, “Now I will\n",
      "help you to get the Golden Bird. When you come near to the castle\n",
      "where the Golden Bird is to be found, let the maiden get down, and I\n",
      "will take her into my care. Then ride with the Golden Horse into the\n",
      "castle-yard. There will be great rejoicing at the sight, and they will\n",
      "bring out the Golden Bird for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When all was accomplished and the King’s Son was about to ride home\n",
      "with his treasures, the Fox said, “Now you shall reward me for my help.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you require for it?” asked the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you get into the wood yonder, shoot me dead, and chop off my head\n",
      "and feet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be fine gratitude,” said the King’s Son, “I cannot possibly\n",
      "do that for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fox said, “If you will not do it I must leave you. But before I\n",
      "go away I will give you a piece of good advice. Be careful about two\n",
      "things. Buy no gallows’-flesh, and do not sit at the edge of any well.”\n",
      "And then he ran into the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth thought, “That is a wonderful beast, he has strange whims.\n",
      "Who is going to buy gallows’-flesh? and the desire to sit at the edge\n",
      "of a well has never yet seized me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his road took him again\n",
      "through the village in which his two brothers had remained. There was a\n",
      "great stir and noise, and, when he asked what was going on, he was told\n",
      "that two men were going to be hanged. As he came nearer to the place\n",
      "he saw that they were his brothers, who had been playing all kinds of\n",
      "wicked pranks, and had squandered their entire wealth. He inquired\n",
      "whether they could not be set free.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you will pay for them,” answered the people; “but why should you\n",
      "waste your money on wicked men, and buy them free?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not think twice about it, but paid for them. And when they were\n",
      "set free they all went on their way together.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to the wood where the Fox had first met them, and, as it\n",
      "was cool and pleasant within it, whilst the sun shone hotly, the two\n",
      "brothers said, “Let us rest a little by the well, and eat and drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He agreed, and whilst they were talking he forgot himself, and sat down\n",
      "upon the edge of the well without foreboding any evil. But the two\n",
      "brothers threw him backwards into the well, took the maiden, the Horse,\n",
      "and the Bird, and went home to their father. “Here we bring you not\n",
      "only the Golden Bird,” said they; “we have won the Golden Horse also,\n",
      "and the maiden from the Golden Castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then was there great joy. But the Horse would not eat, the Bird would\n",
      "not sing, and the maiden sat and wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the youngest brother was not dead. By good fortune the well was\n",
      "dry, and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt. But he could not\n",
      "get out again. Even in this strait, the faithful Fox did not leave him.\n",
      "He came and leapt down to him, and upbraided him for having forgotten\n",
      "his advice. “But yet I cannot give it up so,” he said; “I will help you\n",
      "up again into daylight.” He bade him grasp his tail and keep tight hold\n",
      "of it; and then he pulled him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not out of all danger yet,” said the Fox. “Your brothers were\n",
      "not sure of your death, and have surrounded the wood with watchers, who\n",
      "are to kill you if you let yourself be seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But a poor man was sitting upon the road, with whom the youth changed\n",
      "clothes, and in this way he got to the King’s palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one knew him, but the Bird began to sing, the Horse began to eat,\n",
      "and the beautiful maiden left off weeping. The King, astonished, asked,\n",
      "“What does this mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the maiden said, “I do not know, but I have been so sorrowful and\n",
      "now I am so happy! I feel as if my true Bridegroom had come.” She told\n",
      "him all that had happened, although the other brothers had threatened\n",
      "her with death if she were to betray anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King commanded that all people, who were in his castle, should\n",
      "be brought before him; and amongst them came the youth in his ragged\n",
      "clothes. But the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck. The\n",
      "wicked brothers were seized and put to death, but he was married to the\n",
      "beautiful maiden and declared heir to the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how did it fare with the poor Fox? Long afterward, the King’s Son\n",
      "was once again walking in the wood, when the Fox met him and said, “You\n",
      "have everything now that you can wish for. But there is never an end to\n",
      "my misery, and yet it is in your power to free me,” and again he asked\n",
      "him with tears to shoot him dead and to chop off his head and feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he did it, and scarcely was it done when the Fox was changed into a\n",
      "man, and was no other than the brother of the beautiful Princess, who\n",
      "at last was freed from the magic charm which had been laid upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they\n",
      "lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Two King’s Sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into a\n",
      "wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again. The\n",
      "youngest, who was called Simpleton, set out to seek his brothers. When\n",
      "at length he found them, they mocked him for thinking that he with his\n",
      "simplicity could get through the world, when they two could not make\n",
      "their way, and yet were so much cleverer.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all three traveled away together, and came to an ant-hill. The two\n",
      "elder wanted to destroy it, to see the little ants creeping about in\n",
      "their terror, carrying their eggs away, but Simpleton said, “Leave the\n",
      "creatures in peace. I will not allow you to disturb them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went farther, and came to a lake, on which a great number\n",
      "of ducks were swimming. The two brothers wanted to catch a couple and\n",
      "roast them, but Simpleton would not permit it, and said, “Leave the\n",
      "creatures in peace. I will not suffer you to kill them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At length they came to a bee’s nest, in which there was so much honey,\n",
      "that it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was. The two wanted\n",
      "to make a fire under the tree, and suffocate the bees in order to take\n",
      "away the honey, but Simpleton again stopped them and said, “Leave the\n",
      "creatures in peace. I will not allow you to burn them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the two brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses were\n",
      "standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen. They went\n",
      "through all the halls until they came to a door in which were three\n",
      "locks. In the middle of the door there was a little pane, through which\n",
      "they could see into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "There they saw a little Gray Man sitting at a table. They called him,\n",
      "once, twice, but he did not hear. Then they called him for the third\n",
      "time, when he got up, opened the locks, and came out. He said nothing\n",
      "but led them to a handsomely-spread table; and when they had eaten and\n",
      "drunk, he took each of them to a bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, the little Gray Man came to the eldest, beckoned to him,\n",
      "and conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three\n",
      "tasks, by the doing of which the castle could be delivered. The first\n",
      "was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the Princess’s pearls,\n",
      "a thousand in number, which must be picked up. And if by sunset, one\n",
      "single pearl was wanting, he who had looked for them would be turned to\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eldest went thither, and sought the whole day, but when it came\n",
      "to an end, he had found only one hundred, and what was written on the\n",
      "table came to pass, he was changed into stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure. It did not,\n",
      "however, fare much better with him than with the eldest. He did not\n",
      "find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the turn came to Simpleton, who sought in the moss. But it was\n",
      "so hard to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated\n",
      "himself on a stone, and wept. And while he was thus sitting, the King\n",
      "of the Ants, whose life he had once saved, came with five thousand\n",
      "ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls\n",
      "together, and laid them in a heap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second task was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King’s\n",
      "Daughter’s bedchamber. When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which\n",
      "he had saved, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of\n",
      "the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the third task was the most difficult. From amongst the three\n",
      "sleeping daughters of the King, the youngest and dearest was to be\n",
      "sought out. They resembled each other exactly, and were only to be\n",
      "distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats before they\n",
      "fell asleep: the eldest a bit of sugar; the second a little syrup; and\n",
      "the youngest a spoonful of honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen of the Bees, which Simpleton had protected from the\n",
      "fire, came and tasted the lips of all three. At last she remained\n",
      "sitting on the mouth which had eaten honey; and thus the King’s Son\n",
      "recognized the right Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the enchantment was at an end. Everything was released from sleep,\n",
      "and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural\n",
      "forms. Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest Princess, and after\n",
      "her father’s death became King, while his two brothers received the two\n",
      "other sisters.\n",

      "\n",
      "There was once a forester, who went into the forest to hunt. When he\n",
      "entered it, he heard a screaming as if a little child was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree. In the top of\n",
      "it a little child was sitting. His mother had fallen asleep under the\n",
      "tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen him in her arms, flown\n",
      "down, and snatched him away, and set him on the high tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forester climbed the tree, and brought the child down. And he\n",
      "thought to himself, “I will take him home, and bring him up with my\n",
      "Lina.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took him home, and the two children grew up together. The one he had\n",
      "found in a tree, he called Bird-Found, because a bird had carried it\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bird-Found and Lina loved each other so dearly, that when they did not\n",
      "see each other they were sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forester, however, had an old cook, who one evening took two pails\n",
      "and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\n",
      "to the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lina saw this and said, “Hark you, old Sanna, why are you fetching so\n",
      "much water?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the cook said, “Early to-morrow morning, when the forester is out\n",
      "hunting, I will heat the water. When it is boiling in the kettle, I\n",
      "will throw in Bird-Found, and will boil him in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Betimes next morning, the forester got up and went out hunting, and\n",
      "when he was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to\n",
      "Bird-Found, “If you will never leave me, I will never leave you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bird-Found said, “Neither now, nor ever, will I leave you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Lina, “I will tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many\n",
      "buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing so.\n",
      "She said that early to-morrow morning, when Father was out hunting, she\n",
      "would set on the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you.\n",
      "But we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children, therefore, got up, dressed themselves quickly, and\n",
      "went away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook came into\n",
      "the bedroom to fetch Bird-Found and throw him into it. But when she\n",
      "came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she was terribly frightened, and she said to herself, “What shall\n",
      "I say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are\n",
      "gone? They must be followed instantly and brought back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\n",
      "overtake the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when they\n",
      "saw from afar the three servants running, Lina said to Bird-Found,\n",
      "“Never leave me, and I will never leave you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bird-Found said, “Neither now, nor ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Lina, “Do you become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a\n",
      "rose-tree and one rose on it; the children were nowhere. Said they,\n",
      "“There is nothing to be done here,” and they went home and told the\n",
      "cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush\n",
      "with one rose on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old cook scolded and said, “You simpletons, you should have\n",
      "cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it\n",
      "home with you. Go, and do it at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had therefore to go out and look for the second time. The\n",
      "children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Lina said, “Bird-Found, never leave me, and I will never leave\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bird-Found said, “Neither now, nor ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Lina, “Then do you become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with\n",
      "a chandelier in it. They said therefore to each other, “What can we do\n",
      "here? Let us go home.” When they got home, the cook asked if they had\n",
      "not found them. They said no, they had found nothing but a church, and\n",
      "that there was a chandelier in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cook scolded them and said, “You fools! Why did you not pull the\n",
      "church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went, with the three\n",
      "servants, in pursuit of the children. The children saw from afar that\n",
      "the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Lina, “Bird-Found, never leave me, and I will never leave\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Bird-Found, “Neither now, nor ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Lina, “Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay\n",
      "down by it, and was about to drink it up, when she fell into the water,\n",
      "and there the old Witch had to drown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and\n",
      "if they are not dead, they are living still.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\n",
      "Dunderhead, and was despised, mocked, and put down on every occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened, that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood.\n",
      "Before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle\n",
      "of wine, that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he entered the forest, there met him a little old Gray Man who\n",
      "bade him good-day, and said, “Do give me a piece of cake out of your\n",
      "pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine. I am so hungry and\n",
      "thirsty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prudent youth answered, “If I give you my cake and wine, I\n",
      "shall have none for myself. Be off with you,” and he left the Little\n",
      "Man standing and went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\n",
      "false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm. So he had to go home and\n",
      "have it bound up. And this was the little Gray Man’s doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave\n",
      "him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old Gray\n",
      "Man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of\n",
      "wine. But the second son, too, said with much reason, “What I give you\n",
      "will be taken away from myself. Be off!” and he left the Little Man\n",
      "standing and went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "His punishment, however, was not delayed. When he had made a few\n",
      "strokes at the tree, he struck himself in the leg. So he had to be\n",
      "carried home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dunderhead said, “Father, do let me go and cut wood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The father answered, “Your brothers have hurt themselves doing so.\n",
      "Leave it alone. You do not understand anything about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dunderhead begged so long that at last he said, “Go then. You will\n",
      "get wiser by hurting yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders,\n",
      "and with it a bottle of sour beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the forest the little old Gray Man met him likewise,\n",
      "and greeting him said, “Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of\n",
      "your bottle. I am so hungry and thirsty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dunderhead answered, “I have only cinder-cake and sour beer. If that\n",
      "pleases you, we will sit down and eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and when Dunderhead pulled out his cinder-cake, it\n",
      "was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they ate and drank, and after that the Little Man said, “Since you\n",
      "have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\n",
      "give you good luck. There stands an old tree. Cut it down, and you will\n",
      "find something at the roots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old man took leave of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dunderhead went and cut down the tree; and when it fell there was a\n",
      "Goose sitting in the roots, with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her\n",
      "up, and taking her with him, went to an inn, where he thought he would\n",
      "stay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the Goose\n",
      "and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be. And each\n",
      "wanted one of its feathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eldest thought, “I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\n",
      "feather,” and when Dunderhead was gone out, she seized the Goose by the\n",
      "wing. But her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second came in soon afterward, thinking only of how she might get a\n",
      "feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\n",
      "was held fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the third came with the like intent, and the others screamed\n",
      "out, “Keep away! For goodness’ sake keep away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not understand why she was to keep away. “The others are\n",
      "there,” she thought, “I may as well be there too,” and ran to them. But\n",
      "as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to\n",
      "her. So they had to spend the night with the Goose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, Dunderhead took the Goose under his arm and set out,\n",
      "without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\n",
      "it. They were obliged to run after him, now left, now right, just as he\n",
      "was inclined to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the fields, the parson met them, and when he saw the\n",
      "procession he said, “For shame, you good-for-nothing girls! Why are you\n",
      "running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?” At the\n",
      "same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away.\n",
      "But as soon as he touched her, he likewise stuck fast, and was obliged\n",
      "to run behind. Before long, the sexton came by and saw his master, the\n",
      "parson, running on foot behind three girls. He was astonished at this,\n",
      "and called out, “Hi! your Reverence! Whither away so quickly? Do not\n",
      "forget that we have a christening to-day!” and running after him he\n",
      "took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two laborers\n",
      "came with their hoes from the fields. The parson called out to them\n",
      "and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\n",
      "scarcely touched the sexton, when they were held fast. And now there\n",
      "were seven of them running behind Dunderhead and the Goose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterward, he came to a city, where a King ruled who had a\n",
      "daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had\n",
      "put forth a decree that whosoever should make her laugh should marry\n",
      "her. When Dunderhead heard this, he went with his Goose and all her\n",
      "train before the King’s Daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the\n",
      "other, she began to laugh very loudly as if she would never leave off.\n",
      "Thereupon Dunderhead asked to have her for his wife, and the wedding\n",
      "was celebrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the King’s death, Dunderhead inherited the Kingdom, and lived a\n",
      "long time contentedly with his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was once a widow who had two daughters, one of whom was beautiful\n",
      "and industrious, whilst the other was ugly and lazy. But she was much\n",
      "fonder of the ugly and lazy one. Every day, the other, poor girl, had\n",
      "to sit by a well in the highway, and _spin, spin_ till her fingers bled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it happened, one day, that the shuttle was stained with her blood.\n",
      "She dipped it in the well to wash the stains off, and it dropped out\n",
      "of her hand and fell to the bottom. She began to weep, and ran to the\n",
      "woman, and told her of the mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "She scolded her hard, and was so cruel as to say, “Since you have let\n",
      "the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do. Then in\n",
      "the anguish of her heart, she jumped into the well to get the shuttle.\n",
      "She lost her senses. But when she awoke and came to herself, she was\n",
      "in a lovely meadow, where the sun was shining and thousands of flowers\n",
      "were growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along this meadow she went, and at length came to a baker’s oven full\n",
      "of bread. And the bread cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, take me out! Take me out!\n",
      "      Or I shall burn. I am well baked!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she went up to it, and, with the bread shovel, took out all the\n",
      "loaves one after the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples,\n",
      "and it called to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, shake me! Shake me!\n",
      "      We apples are all ripe!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain, and went on\n",
      "shaking till they were all down. And when she had gathered them into a\n",
      "heap, she went on her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, she came to a little house out of which an Old Woman was\n",
      "peeping. She had such large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was\n",
      "about to run away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Old Woman called out to her, “What are you afraid of, my Child?\n",
      "Stay with me. If you will do the work in my house carefully, you shall\n",
      "be the better for it! Only you must take care to make my bed well, and\n",
      "to shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly--for then it snows on\n",
      "earth. I am Mother Holle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Old Woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took heart, and\n",
      "willingly entered her service. She did everything to the Old Woman’s\n",
      "satisfaction, and always shook her bed so hard that the feathers flew\n",
      "about like snowflakes. So she lived happily with her, never an angry\n",
      "word, and boiled or roasted meat every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stayed some time with Mother Holle, then she grew sad. At first she\n",
      "did not know what was the matter with her, but, by and by, she found\n",
      "that it was homesickness. Although she was many thousand times better\n",
      "off here than at home, still she had a longing to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, she said to the Old Woman, “I am longing for home. However\n",
      "well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer. I must go up again\n",
      "to my own people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother Holle said, “I am pleased that you long for your home again. You\n",
      "have served me so faithfully, that I myself will take you up again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon she took her by the hand, and led her to a large door. The\n",
      "door was opened, and just as the girl was standing beneath the doorway,\n",
      "a heavy shower of Gold-Rain fell, and all the gold stuck to her so that\n",
      "she was covered with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall have that because you are so industrious,” said Mother\n",
      "Holle. And at the same time, she gave her back the shuttle which she\n",
      "had let fall into the well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the door closed, and the girl found herself again upon the\n",
      "earth, not far from her mother’s house.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she went into the yard, the cock was standing by the well, and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n",
      "      Your Golden Girl’s came back to you!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she went into her mother. And as she was thus covered with gold, she\n",
      "was welcomed by both her and the sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl told all that had happened to her. As soon as the mother heard\n",
      "how she had come by such great riches, she was anxious for the same\n",
      "good fortune to befall her ugly and lazy daughter. She had to seat\n",
      "herself by the well and spin. And in order that her shuttle might be\n",
      "stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a thorn-bush, and pricked\n",
      "her finger. Then she threw her shuttle into the well, and jumped in\n",
      "after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came like the other to the beautiful meadow, and walked along the\n",
      "very same path. When she got to the oven, the bread cried again:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, take me out! Take me out!\n",
      "      Or I shall burn. I am well baked!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the lazy thing answered, “As if I wanted to soil myself!” and on\n",
      "she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon she came to the apple-tree, which cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Oh, shake me! Shake me!\n",
      "      We apples are all ripe!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she answered, “I like that! One of you might fall on my head!” and\n",
      "on she went.\n",

      "When she came to Mother Holle’s house, she was not afraid, for she had\n",
      "already heard about her big teeth. She hired herself out immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first day, she made herself work diligently, and obeyed Mother\n",
      "Holle, when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking of all\n",
      "the gold that she would give her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the second day, she began to be lazy, and on the third day stall\n",
      "more so, for then she would not get up in the morning. Neither did\n",
      "she make Mother Holle’s bed carefully, nor shake it so as to make the\n",
      "feathers fly up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother Holle was soon tired of this, and gave her notice to leave.\n",
      "The lazy girl was willing to go, and thought that now the Gold-Rain\n",
      "would come. Mother Holle led her to the great doorway. But while she\n",
      "was standing under it, instead of gold, a big kettleful of pitch was\n",
      "emptied over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the reward of your service,” said Mother Holle, and shut the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the lazy girl went home. She was covered with pitch, and the cock by\n",
      "the well, as soon as he saw her, cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n",
      "      Your Pitchy Girl’s come back to you!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the pitch stuck fast to her, and could not be got off so long as\n",

      "Hill and vale do not come together, but the children of men do, good\n",
      "and bad. In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other\n",
      "in their travels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full\n",
      "of enjoyment. He saw the shoemaker coming toward him from the other\n",
      "side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he\n",
      "sang a little mocking song to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "      _Sew me the seam,\n",
      "      Draw me the thread,\n",
      "      Spread it with pitch,\n",
      "      Knock the nail on the head._\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker, however, could not endure a joke. He pulled a face as if\n",
      "he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize\n",
      "the tailor by the throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said,\n",
      "“No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began\n",
      "to clear away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, “I spoke civilly to\n",
      "you. One speaks well after much drinking, but not after much thirst.\n",
      "Shall we travel together?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” answered the tailor, “if only it suits you to go into a\n",
      "big town where there is no lack of work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is just where I want to go,” answered the shoemaker. “In a small\n",
      "nest there is nothing to earn; and in the country, people like to go\n",
      "barefoot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They traveled therefore onward together, and always set one foot before\n",
      "the other like a weazel in the snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break. When\n",
      "they reached a town, they went about and paid their respects to the\n",
      "tradesmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such pretty red\n",
      "cheeks, every one gave him work willingly. And when luck was good, the\n",
      "master’s daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch, as well. When he\n",
      "again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor had always the most in his\n",
      "bundle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face, and thought, “The greater\n",
      "the rascal the more the luck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with\n",
      "his comrade. If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered\n",
      "good cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced,\n",
      "and it was lightly come, lightly go, with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had traveled for some time, they came to a great forest\n",
      "through which passed the road to the capital. Two foot-paths, however,\n",
      "led through it, one of them a seven days’ journey, and the other only\n",
      "two. But neither of the travelers knew which way was the short one.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took counsel together\n",
      "as to what they should do and for how many days they should provide\n",
      "themselves with bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker said, “One must look before one leaps. I will take with\n",
      "me bread for a week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said the tailor, “drag bread for seven days on one’s back like\n",
      "a beast of burden, and not be able to look about. I shall trust in God,\n",
      "and not trouble myself about anything! The money I have in my pocket is\n",
      "as good in summer as in winter; but in hot weather bread gets dry and\n",
      "mouldy into the bargain. Even my coat does not go as far as it might.\n",
      "Besides, why should we not find the right way? Bread for two days, and\n",
      "that’s enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each, therefore, bought his own bread. And then they tried their luck\n",
      "in the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as quiet there as in a church. No wind stirred, no brook\n",
      "murmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches, no\n",
      "sunbeam forced its way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker spoke never a word, the heavy bread weighed down his back\n",
      "until the perspiration streamed down his cross and gloomy face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tailor, however, was quite merry; he jumped about, whistled on a\n",
      "leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself, “God in Heaven must be\n",
      "pleased to see me so happy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This lasted two days, but on the third the forest would not come to an\n",
      "end, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread, so after all his heart\n",
      "sank down a yard deeper. In the meantime, he did not lose courage, but\n",
      "relied on God and on his luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day, he lay down in the evening hungry under a tree, and\n",
      "rose again next morning hungry still.\n",
      "\n",
      "So also passed the fourth day, and when the shoemaker seated himself on\n",
      "a fallen tree and devoured his dinner, the tailor was only a looker-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he begged for a little piece of bread the other laughed mockingly,\n",
      "and said, “You have always been so merry, now you can try for once what\n",
      "it is to be sad. The birds which sing too early in the morning, are\n",
      "struck by the hawk in the evening,” in short he was pitiless.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the fifth morning, the poor tailor could no longer stand up, and\n",
      "was hardly able to utter one word for weakness. His cheeks were white,\n",
      "and his eyes red.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the shoemaker said to him, “I will give you a bit of bread to-day,\n",
      "but in return for it, I will put out your right eye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The unhappy tailor, who still wished to save his life, could not do it\n",
      "in any other way. He wept once more with both eyes, and then held them\n",
      "out. The shoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye\n",
      "with a sharp knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had formerly said to\n",
      "him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry, “Eat what one can,\n",
      "and suffer what one must.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had consumed his dearly-bought bread, he got on his legs again,\n",
      "forgot his misery and comforted himself with the thought that he could\n",
      "always see enough with one eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again, and gnawed him\n",
      "almost to the heart. In the evening he fell down by a tree, and on the\n",
      "seventh morning he could not raise himself up for faintness, and death\n",
      "was close at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the shoemaker, “I will show mercy and give you bread once\n",
      "more, but you shall not have it for nothing. I shall put out your other\n",
      "eye for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the tailor felt how thoughtless his life had been, prayed to\n",
      "God for forgiveness, and said, “Do what you will, I will bear what I\n",
      "must, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on passively,\n",
      "and that an hour will come when the evil deed, which you have done to\n",
      "me and which I have not deserved of you, will be requited. When times\n",
      "were good with me, I shared what I had with you. My trade is of that\n",
      "kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other. If I no\n",
      "longer have my eyes and can sew no more, I must go a-begging. At any\n",
      "rate, do not leave me here alone when I am blind, or I shall die of\n",
      "hunger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker, however, who had driven God out of his heart, took the\n",
      "knife and put out his left eye. Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat,\n",
      "held out a stick to him, and drew him on behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun went down, they got out of the forest, and before them in\n",
      "the open country stood the gallows. Thither the shoemaker guided the\n",
      "blind tailor, and then left him alone and went his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he\n",
      "slept the whole night. When day dawned he awoke, but knew not where he\n",
      "lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, and a crow sat on the\n",
      "head of each of them. Then one of the men who had been hanged began to\n",
      "speak, and said, “Brother, are you awake?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am awake,” answered the second.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I will tell you something,” said the first; “the dew which this\n",
      "night has fallen down over us from the gallows, gives every one who\n",
      "washes himself with it, his eyes again. If blind people did but know\n",
      "this, how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be\n",
      "possible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tailor heard that, he took his pocket-handkerchief, pressed it\n",
      "on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets of his\n",
      "eyes with it. Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had\n",
      "said, and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise behind the\n",
      "mountains. In the plain before him, lay the great royal city with its\n",
      "magnificent gates and hundred towers. The golden balls and crosses\n",
      "which were on the spires began to shine. He could distinguish every\n",
      "leaf on the trees, saw the birds which flew past, and the midges which\n",
      "danced in the air. He took a needle out of his pocket, and as he could\n",
      "thread it as well as ever he had done, his heart danced with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw himself on his knees, thanked God for the mercy he had shown\n",
      "him, and said his morning prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he took his bundle on his back, and soon forgot the pain of heart\n",
      "he had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at\n",
      "large. He caught it by the mane, and wanted to spring on it and ride\n",
      "into the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foal, however, begged to be set free. “I am still too young,” it\n",
      "said, “even a light tailor such as you are would break my back in\n",
      "two--let me go till I have grown strong. A time may come when I can\n",
      "reward you for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Run off,” said the tailor, “I see you are still a giddy thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave it a touch with a switch over its back, whereupon it kicked up\n",
      "its hind legs for joy, leapt over hedges and ditches, and galloped away\n",
      "into the open country.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before. “The sun\n",
      "to be sure fills my eyes,” said he, “but the bread does not fill my\n",
      "mouth. The first thing that comes across me and is even half eatable,\n",
      "will have to suffer for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halt, halt!” cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg. “I don’t\n",
      "know if you are good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great\n",
      "choice. I must cut your head off, and roast you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t do that,” replied the stork; “I am a sacred bird which brings\n",
      "mankind great profit, and no one ever does me an injury. Leave me my\n",
      "life, and I may do you good in some other way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, be off, Cousin Longlegs,” said the tailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s to be the end of this?” said the tailor to himself at last; “my\n",
      "hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more empty.\n",
      "Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond,\n",
      "come swimming toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You come just at the right moment,” said he, and laid hold of one of\n",
      "them and was about to wring its neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this an old duck, which was hidden among the reeds, began to scream\n",
      "loudly and swam to him with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare\n",
      "her dear children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you not imagine,” said she, “how your mother would mourn if any\n",
      "one wanted to carry you off, and give you your death blow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only be quiet,” said the good-tempered tailor; “you shall keep your\n",
      "children,” and he put the prisoner back into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he turned round, he was standing in front of an old tree which was\n",
      "partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed,” said the\n",
      "tailor; “the honey will refresh me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Queen-Bee came out, threatened him and said, “If you touch my\n",
      "people, and destroy my nest, our stings shall pierce your skin like ten\n",
      "thousand red-hot needles. But if you will leave us in peace and go your\n",
      "way, we will do you a service for it another time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done. “Three\n",
      "dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner!” He dragged\n",
      "himself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town. It was\n",
      "just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn, and he\n",
      "was able to sit down at once to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was satisfied, he said, “Now I will get to work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He went round the town, sought a master, and soon found a good\n",
      "situation. As he had thoroughly learned his trade, it was not long\n",
      "before he became famous, and every one wanted to have a new coat made\n",
      "by the little tailor, whose importance increased daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can go no further in skill,” said he, “and yet things improve every\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the King appointed him court-tailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how things do happen in the world! On the very same day his former\n",
      "comrade, the shoemaker, also became court-shoemaker. When the latter\n",
      "caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he had once more two healthy\n",
      "eyes, his conscience troubled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before he takes revenge on me,” thought he to himself, “I must dig a\n",
      "pit for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He, however, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening when work was over and it had grown dusk, he stole to\n",
      "the King and said, “Lord King, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has\n",
      "boasted that he will get the gold crown back again, which was lost in\n",
      "ancient times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would please me very much,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "He caused the tailor to be brought before him next morning, and ordered\n",
      "him to get the crown back again, or to leave the town for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oho!” thought the tailor, “a rogue gives more than he has got. If the\n",
      "surly King wants me to do what can be done by no one, I will not wait\n",
      "till morning, but will go out of the town at once, to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He packed up his bundle, but when he was without the gate, he could not\n",
      "help being sorry to give up his good fortune and turn his back on the\n",
      "town in which all had gone so well with him. He came to the pond where\n",
      "he had made the acquaintance of the ducks.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment the old one whose young ones he had spared was\n",
      "sitting there by the shore, pluming herself with her beak. She knew him\n",
      "again and asked why he was hanging his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not be surprised when you hear what has befallen me,” replied\n",
      "the tailor, and told her his fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that be all,” said the duck, “we can help you. The crown fell into\n",
      "the water, and lies at the bottom. We will soon bring it up again for\n",
      "you. In the meantime just spread out your handkerchief on the bank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She dived down with her twelve young ones. And in five minutes she was\n",
      "up again with the crown resting on her wings. The twelve young ones\n",
      "were swimming round about and had put their beaks under it, and were\n",
      "helping to carry it. They all swam to the shore and put the crown on\n",
      "the handkerchief.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was. When the sun shone on\n",
      "it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles. The tailor tied his\n",
      "handkerchief together by the four corners, and carried it to the King,\n",
      "who was full of joy, and put a gold chain round the tailor’s neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the shoemaker saw that one stroke had failed, he contrived a\n",
      "second, and went to the King and said, “Lord King, the tailor has\n",
      "become insolent again. He boasts that he will copy in wax the whole of\n",
      "the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, loose or fast,\n",
      "inside and out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy in wax the whole\n",
      "of the royal palace, with everything that pertained to it, movable\n",
      "or immovable, within and without. And if he did not succeed in doing\n",
      "this, or if so much as one nail on the wall were wanting, he should be\n",
      "imprisoned for his whole life underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tailor thought, “It gets worse and worse! No one can endure that!”\n",
      "and threw his bundle on his back, and went forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head. The\n",
      "bees came flying out, and the Queen-Bee asked him if he had a stiff\n",
      "neck, since he held his head so awry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, no,” answered the tailor, “something quite different weighs me\n",
      "down,” and he told her what the King had demanded of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves, and the Queen-Bee\n",
      "said, “Just go home again. But come back to-morrow at this time, and\n",
      "bring a large sheet with you, and then all will be well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he turned back again, but the bees flew to the royal palace and\n",
      "straight into it through the open windows, crept round about into every\n",
      "corner, and inspected everything most carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they hurried back and modeled the palace in wax with such rapidity\n",
      "that any one looking on would have thought it was growing before his\n",
      "eyes. By the evening all was ready.\n",

      "at the third time it fell violently down. At the same instant there was\n",
      "a terrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the\n",
      "courtyard sprang like a cannon ball into the air, and over the castle.\n",
      "Directly after it, a jet of water rose as high as a man on horseback,\n",

      "the children in swaddling-clothes into the town. So for once, I can\n",

      "\n",
      "The little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the\n",

      "in, and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel, and stretched\n",
      "out its little hands to the Queen. The stork laid it in her lap, and\n",
      "she caressed it and kissed it, and was beside herself with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the stork flew away he took his traveling bag off his back and\n",
      "handed it over to the Queen. In it there were little paper parcels\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The road to the forest led him to the gallows. Worn out with anger,\n",

      "closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows flew down from\n",
      "the heads of the men who were hanging there, and pecked his eyes out.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the daytime, she changed herself into a cat or a screech-owl, but\n",
      "in the evening she took her proper shape again as a human being. She\n",

      "If any one came within one hundred paces of the castle he was obliged\n",

      "changed her into a bird, shut her up in a wicker-work cage, and carried\n",
      "the cage into a room in the castle. She had about seven thousand cages\n",
      "of rare birds in the castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there was once a maiden who was called Jorinda, who was fairer\n",

      "\n",

      "sorrowful. Joringel was sorrowful too. They were as sad as if they were\n",
      "about to die. Then they looked around them, and were quite at a loss,\n",
      "for they did not know by which way to go home. The sun was half above\n",
      "the mountain and half set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joringel looked through the bushes, and saw the old walls of the castle\n",
      "close at hand. He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jorinda was singing:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_My little Bird, with the necklace red,\n",

      "\n",
      "A screech-owl with glowing eyes flew three times round about her, and\n",
      "three times cried, “_to-whoo, to-whoo, to-whoo!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joringel could not move. He stood there like a stone, and could neither\n",
      "weep nor speak, nor move hand or foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had now set. The owl flew into the thicket. Directly afterward\n",
      "there came out of it a crooked Old Woman, yellow and lean, with large\n",
      "red eyes and a hooked nose, the point of which reached to her chin. She\n",
      "muttered to herself, caught the Nightingale, and took it away in her\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joringel could neither speak nor move from the spot. The Nightingale\n",
      "was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the woman came back, and said in a hollow voice, “Greet thee,\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Joringel was freed. He fell on his knees before the woman and\n",

      "lamented, but all in vain, “Ah, what is to become of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joringel went away, and at last came to a strange village. There he\n",
      "kept sheep for a long time. He often walked round and round the castle,\n",
      "but not too near to it. One night he dreamt that he found a Blood-Red\n",
      "Flower, in the middle of which was a beautiful large pearl; that he\n",
      "picked the flower and went with it to the castle, and that everything\n",
      "he touched with the flower was freed from enchantment. He also dreamt\n",
      "that by means of it, he recovered his Jorinda.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, when he awoke, he began to seek over hill and dale to\n",
      "find such a flower. He sought until the ninth day, and then, early in\n",
      "the morning, he found the Blood-Red Flower. In the middle of it, there\n",
      "was a large dew-drop, as big as the finest pearl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day and night, he journeyed with this flower to the castle. When he\n",
      "was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast, but walked on to\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joringel was full of joy. He touched the door with the flower, and it\n",
      "sprang open. He walked in through the courtyard, and listened for the\n",
      "sound of the birds. At last he heard it. He went on, and found the room\n",
      "from whence it came. There the Witch was feeding the birds in the seven\n",
      "thousand cages.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she saw Joringel, she was angry, very angry, and scolded and spat\n",
      "poison and gall, but she could not come within two paces of him. He did\n",
      "not take any notice of her, but went and looked at the cages with the\n",
      "birds. But there were many hundred Nightingales, how was he to find his\n",
      "Jorinda again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then he saw the Old Woman quietly take away a cage with a bird in\n",
      "it, and go toward the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swiftly he sprang toward her, touched the cage with the flower, and\n",
      "also the Old Woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could now no longer bewitch any one. And Jorinda was standing\n",
      "there, clasping him round the neck, and she was as beautiful as ever!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was once a man who understood all kinds of arts. He served\n",
      "in war, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he\n",
      "received his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the\n",
      "way. “Stop,” said he, “I shall not be content with this. If I can but\n",
      "meet with the right people, the King will have to give me all the\n",
      "treasure of the country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing\n",
      "therein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn. He\n",
      "said to him, “Will you be my servant and go with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he answered, “but, first, I will take this little bundle of\n",
      "sticks home to my mother,” and he took one of the trees, and wrapped\n",
      "it round the five others, lifted the bundle on his back and carried it\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he returned and went with his master, who said, “We two ought to\n",
      "be able to get through the world very well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had walked on for a short while they found a huntsman who was\n",
      "kneeling, had shouldered his gun, and was about to fire. The master\n",
      "said to him, “Huntsman, what are you going to shoot?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, “Two miles from here a fly is sitting on the branch of an\n",
      "oak-tree, and I want to shoot its left eye out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come with me,” said the man, “if we three are together, we\n",
      "certainly ought to be able to get on in the world!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman was ready, and went with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to seven windmills whose sails were turning round with great\n",
      "speed, and yet no wind was blowing either on the right or the left, and\n",
      "no leaf was stirring. Then said the man, “I know not what is driving\n",
      "the windmills, not a breath of air is stirring,” and he went onward\n",
      "with his servants, and when they had walked two miles they saw a man\n",
      "sitting on a tree, who was shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the\n",
      "other. “Good gracious! what are you doing up there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, “Two miles from here are seven windmills. Look, I am\n",
      "blowing them till they turn round.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come with me,” said the man. “If we four are together, we shall\n",
      "carry the whole world before us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the blower came down and went with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while they saw a man who was standing on one leg and had taken\n",
      "off the other, and laid it beside him. Then the master said, “You have\n",
      "arranged things very comfortably to have a rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a runner,” he replied, “and to stop myself running far too fast,\n",
      "I have taken off one of my legs, for if I run with both, I go quicker\n",
      "than any bird can fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come with me. If we five are together, we shall carry the whole\n",
      "world before us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before they met a man who wore a cap, but had put it\n",
      "quite on one ear. Then the master said to him, “Gracefully! gracefully!\n",
      "don’t stick your cap on one ear, you look just like a tom-fool!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must not wear it otherwise,” said he, “for if I set my hat straight,\n",
      "a terrible frost comes on, and all the birds in the air are frozen, and\n",
      "drop dead on the ground.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come with me,” said the master. “If we six are together, we can\n",
      "carry the whole world before us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the six came to a town where the King had proclaimed that whosoever\n",
      "ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be her\n",
      "husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the man presented himself and said, “I will, however, let my\n",
      "servant run for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King replied, “Then his life also must be staked, so that his head\n",
      "and thine are both set on the victory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When that was settled and made secure, the man buckled the other leg on\n",
      "the runner, and said to him, “Now be nimble, and help us to win.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was fixed that the one who was the first to bring some water from a\n",
      "far distant well, was to be the victor. The runner received a pitcher,\n",
      "and the King’s Daughter one too, and they began to run at the same\n",
      "time. But in an instant, when the King’s Daughter had got a very little\n",
      "way, the people who were looking on could see no more of the runner, it\n",
      "was just as if the wind had whistled by.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a short time he reached the well, filled his pitcher with water,\n",
      "and turned back. Half-way home, however, he was overcome with fatigue,\n",
      "and set his pitcher down, lay down himself, and fell asleep. He had,\n",
      "however, made a pillow of a horse’s skull which was lying on the\n",
      "ground, in order that he might lie uncomfortably, and soon wake up\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the King’s Daughter, who could also run very\n",
      "well--quite as well as any ordinary mortal can--had reached the well,\n",
      "and was hurrying back with her pitcher full of water, and when she saw\n",
      "the runner lying there asleep, she was glad and said, “My enemy is\n",
      "delivered over into my hands,” emptied his pitcher, and ran on.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now all would have been lost if by good luck the huntsman had not\n",
      "been standing at the top of the castle, and had not seen everything\n",
      "with his sharp eyes. Then said he, “The King’s Daughter shall still not\n",
      "prevail against us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He loaded his gun, and shot so cleverly, that he shot the horse’s\n",
      "skull away from under the runner’s head without hurting him. Then the\n",
      "runner awoke, leapt up, and saw that his pitcher was empty, and that\n",
      "the King’s Daughter was already far in advance. He did not lose heart,\n",
      "however, but ran back to the well with his pitcher, again drew some\n",
      "water, and was still at home again, ten minutes before the King’s\n",
      "Daughter. “Behold!” said he, “I have not bestirred myself till now. It\n",
      "did not deserve to be called running before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it pained the King, and still more his daughter, that she should\n",
      "be carried off by a common disbanded soldier like that. So they took\n",
      "counsel with each other how to get rid of him and his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the King to her, “I have thought of a way. Don’t be afraid,\n",
      "they shall not come back again.” And he said to them, “You shall now\n",
      "make merry together, and eat and drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He conducted them to a room which had a floor of iron, and the doors\n",
      "also were of iron, and the windows were guarded with iron bars. There\n",
      "was a table in the room covered with delicious food, and the King said\n",
      "to them, “Go in, and enjoy yourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they were inside, he ordered the doors to be shut and bolted.\n",
      "Then he sent for the cook, and commanded him to make a fire under the\n",
      "room until the iron became red-hot. This the cook did, and the six who\n",
      "were sitting at table began to feel quite warm, and they thought the\n",
      "heat was caused by the food. But as it became still greater, and they\n",
      "wanted to get out, and found that the doors and windows were bolted,\n",
      "they became aware that the King had an evil intention, and wanted to\n",
      "suffocate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He shall not succeed, however,” said the one with the cap. “I will\n",
      "cause a frost to come, before which the fire shall be ashamed, and\n",
      "creep away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he put his cap on straight, and immediately there came such a\n",
      "frost that all heat disappeared, and the food on the dishes began to\n",
      "freeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "When an hour or two had passed by, and the King believed that they had\n",
      "perished in the heat, he had the doors opened to behold them himself.\n",
      "But when the doors were opened, all six were standing there, alive\n",
      "and well, and said that they should very much like to get out to warm\n",
      "themselves, for the very food was fast frozen to the dishes with the\n",
      "cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, full of anger, the King went down to the cook, scolded him and\n",
      "asked why he had not done what he had been ordered to do. But the\n",
      "cook replied, “There is heat enough there, just look yourself.” Then\n",
      "the King saw that a fierce fire was burning under the iron room, and\n",
      "perceived that there was no getting the better of the six in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the King considered how to get rid of his unpleasant guests, and\n",
      "caused their chief to be brought and said, “If you will take gold and\n",
      "renounce my daughter, you shall have as much as you wish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, Lord King,” he answered, “give me as much as my servant can\n",
      "carry, and I will not ask for your daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the King was satisfied, and the other continued, “In fourteen\n",
      "days, I will come and fetch it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon he summoned together all the tailors in the whole kingdom,\n",
      "and they were to sit for fourteen days and sew a sack. And when it was\n",
      "ready, the strong one who could tear up trees had to take it on his\n",
      "back, and go with it to the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the King, “Who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a\n",
      "bundle of linen on his back that is as big as a house?” and he was\n",
      "alarmed and said, “What a lot of gold he can carry away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he commanded a ton of gold to be brought. It took sixteen of his\n",
      "strongest men to carry it, but the strong one snatched it up in one\n",
      "hand, put it in his sack, and said, “Why don’t you bring more at the\n",
      "same time?--that hardly covers the bottom!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, little by little, the King caused all his treasure to be brought\n",
      "thither, and the strong one pushed it into the sack, and still the sack\n",
      "was not half full with it. “Bring more,” cried he, “these few crumbs\n",
      "don’t fill it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then seven thousand carts with gold had to be gathered together in the\n",
      "whole kingdom, and the strong one thrust them and the oxen harnessed to\n",
      "them into his sack. “I will examine it no longer,” said he, “but will\n",
      "just take what comes, so long as the sack is but full.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When all that was inside, there was still room for a great deal\n",
      "more. Then he said, “I will just make an end of the thing. People do\n",
      "sometimes tie up a sack even when it is not full.” So he took it on his\n",
      "back, and went away with his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King now saw how one single man was carrying away the entire\n",
      "wealth of the country, he became enraged, and bade his horsemen mount\n",
      "and pursue the six, and ordered them to take the sack away from the\n",
      "strong one. Two regiments speedily overtook the six, and called out,\n",
      "“You are prisoners. Put down the sack with the gold, or you will all be\n",
      "cut to pieces!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What say you?” cried the blower, “that we are prisoners! Rather than\n",
      "that should happen, all of you shall dance about in the air.” And he\n",
      "closed one nostril, and with the other blew on the two regiments. Then\n",
      "they were driven away from each other, and carried into the blue sky\n",
      "over all the mountains--one here, the other there.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sergeant cried for mercy. He had nine wounds, and was a brave\n",
      "fellow who did not deserve ill-treatment. The blower stopped a little\n",
      "so that he came down without injury, and then the blower said to him,\n",
      "“Now go home to your King, and tell him he had better send some more\n",
      "horsemen, and I will blow them all into the air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King was informed of this he said, “Let the rascals go. They\n",
      "have the best of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the six conveyed the riches home, divided it amongst them, and\n",
      "lived in content until their death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was once upon a time, an old Queen, whose husband had been dead\n",
      "for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Princess grew up, she was betrothed to a Prince who lived very\n",
      "far away. When the time came for her to be married, and she had to\n",
      "journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for\n",
      "her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets, also of gold\n",
      "and silver, and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained\n",
      "to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "She likewise sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to ride with her, and\n",
      "hand her over to the Bridegroom. Each had a horse for the journey, but\n",
      "the horse of the King’s Daughter was called Falada, and could speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her\n",
      "bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled.\n",
      "Then she held a white handkerchief to it, into which she let three\n",
      "drops of blood fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave the handkerchief to her daughter and said, “Dear Child,\n",
      "preserve this carefully. It will be of service to you on your way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they took a sorrowful leave of each other. The Princess put the\n",
      "piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to\n",
      "her Bridegroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said\n",
      "to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and take my cup which you have brought\n",
      "with you, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to\n",
      "drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are thirsty,” said the waiting-maid, “get off your horse\n",
      "yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water. I don’t choose to be\n",
      "your servant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So in her great thirst the Princess alighted, bent down over the water\n",
      "in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden\n",
      "cup. Then she said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the three drops of blood answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_If thy Mother only knew,\n",
      "      ’Twould surely break her heart in two!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the King’s Daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched\n",
      "her, and she was thirsty once more. When they came to a stream of\n",
      "water, she again cried to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and give me some\n",
      "water in my golden cup,” for she had long ago forgotten the girl’s ill\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, “If you wish to drink,\n",
      "drink as you can, I don’t choose to be your maid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in her great thirst the King’s Daughter alighted, bent over the\n",
      "flowing stream, wept and said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the drops of blood\n",
      "again replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_If thy Mother only knew,\n",
      "      ’Twould surely break her heart in two!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the\n",
      "handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and\n",
      "floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her\n",
      "trouble. The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to\n",
      "think that she had now power over the Bride, for since the Princess had\n",
      "lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was\n",
      "called Falada, the waiting-maid said, “Falada is more suitable for me,\n",
      "and my nag will do for you,” and the Princess had to be content with\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the Princess exchange\n",
      "her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she was\n",
      "compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say\n",
      "one word of this to any one at the Royal Court. And if she had not\n",
      "taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada saw\n",
      "all this, and observed it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true Bride the bad horse,\n",
      "and thus they traveled onward, until they entered the royal palace.\n",
      "There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the Prince sprang\n",
      "forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and\n",
      "thought she was his Bride. She was conducted up-stairs, but the real\n",
      "Princess was left standing below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old King looked out of the window and saw her standing in\n",
      "the courtyard, and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was. He\n",
      "instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the Bride about the\n",
      "girl she had with her, who was standing down below in the courtyard,\n",
      "and who she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I picked her up on my way for a companion. Give the girl something to\n",
      "work at, that she may not stand idle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the old King had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, “I\n",
      "have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was called Conrad, and the true Bride had to help him to tend\n",
      "the geese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterward the false Bride said to the young King, “Dearest\n",
      "Husband, I beg you to do me a favor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, “I will do so most willingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then send for the butcher, and have the head of the horse on which I\n",
      "rode here, cut off, for it vexed me on the way.” In reality, she was\n",
      "afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the King’s\n",
      "Daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she succeeded in making the King promise that it should be done,\n",
      "and the faithful Falada was to die. This came to the ears of the real\n",
      "Princess, and she secretly promised the butcher a piece of gold if he\n",
      "would perform a small service for her. There was a great dark-looking\n",
      "gateway in the town, through which, morning and evening, she had to\n",
      "pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nail up Falada’s head on\n",
      "it, so that she might see him again? The butcher promised to do that,\n",
      "and cut off the head, and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath\n",
      "this gateway, she said in passing:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Alas, Falada, hanging there!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the head answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Alas! young Queen, how ill you fare!\n",
      "      If this your tender Mother knew,\n",
      "      Her heart would surely break in two!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went still farther out of the town, and drove their geese\n",
      "into the country. And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down\n",
      "and unbound her hair which was like pure gold. Conrad saw it and\n",
      "delighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs. Then\n",
      "she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,\n",
      "      Blow Conrad’s little hat away,\n",
      "      And make him chase it here and there,\n",
      "      Until I’ve braided all my hair,\n",
      "      And bound it up again._”\n",
      "\n",
      "And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad’s hat far away\n",
      "across county, and he was forced to run after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting\n",
      "it up again and he could not get any of it. Then Conrad was angry,\n",
      "and would not speak to her. And thus they watched the geese until the\n",
      "evening, and then they went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway,\n",
      "the maiden said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Alas, Falada, hanging there!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Falada answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Alas! young Queen, how ill you fare!\n",
      "      If this your tender Mother knew,\n",
      "      Her heart would surely break in two!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair.\n",
      "Conrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,\n",
      "      Blow Conrad’s little hat away,\n",
      "      And make him chase it here and there,\n",
      "      Until I’ve braided all my hair,\n",
      "      And bound it up again._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away,\n",
      "and Conrad was forced to run after it. When he came back, her hair had\n",
      "been put up a long time, and he could get none of it. So they looked\n",
      "after their geese till evening came.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the evening, after they had got home, Conrad went to the old\n",
      "King, and said, “I won’t tend the geese with that girl any longer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” inquired the old King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, because she vexes me the whole day long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old King commanded him to relate what it was that she did to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Conrad said, “In the morning, when we pass beneath the dark gateway\n",
      "with the flock, there is a sorry horse’s head on the wall, and she says\n",
      "to it:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Alas, Falada, hanging there!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "And the head replies:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Alas! young Queen, how ill you fare!\n",
      "      If this your tender Mother knew,\n",
      "      Her heart would surely break in two!_’”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose-pasture, and\n",
      "how when there he had to chase his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old King commanded him to drive his flock out again next day, and\n",
      "as soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gateway, and\n",
      "heard how the maiden spoke to the head of Falada. Then he went into the\n",
      "country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow. There he soon\n",
      "saw with his own eyes, the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringing their\n",
      "flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair, which\n",
      "shone with radiance. And soon she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,\n",
      "      Blow Conrad’s little hat away,\n",
      "      And make him chase it here and there,\n",
      "      Until I’ve braided all my hair,\n",
      "      And bound it up again._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad’s hat, so that he had\n",
      "to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting\n",
      "her hair. All of which the King observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, quite unseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home\n",
      "in the evening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I may not tell you that, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human\n",
      "being, for I have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me.\n",
      "If I had not done that, I should have lost my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He urged her and left her no peace, but he could draw nothing from her.\n",
      "Then said he, “If you will not tell me anything, tell your sorrows to\n",
      "the iron stove there,” and he went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she crept into the iron stove, and began to weep and lament, and\n",
      "emptied her whole heart, and said, “Here am I deserted by the whole\n",
      "world, and yet I am a King’s Daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by\n",
      "force brought me to such a pass, that I have been compelled to put off\n",
      "my royal apparel. She has taken my place with my Bridegroom, and I have\n",
      "to do the mean work of a goose-girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_If my Mother only knew,\n",
      "      ’Twould surely break her heart in two!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old King was standing outside by the pipe of the stove, and was\n",
      "listening to what she said, and heard it. Then he came back again,\n",
      "and bade her come out of the stove. And royal garments were placed on\n",
      "her, and it was marvelous how beautiful she was! The old King called\n",
      "his son, and revealed to him, that he had got the false Bride who was\n",
      "only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was standing there, as the\n",
      "goose-girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young King rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and\n",
      "youth, and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all\n",
      "good friends were invited. At the head of the table sat the Bridegroom\n",
      "with the King’s Daughter at one side of him, and the waiting-maid on\n",
      "the other, but the waiting-maid was blinded, and did not recognize the\n",
      "Princess in her dazzling array.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the old King asked the\n",
      "waiting-maid as a riddle, what a person deserved who had behaved in\n",
      "such and such a way to her master, and at the same time related the\n",
      "whole story, and asked what sentence such a one merited?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the false Bride said, “She deserves no better fate than to be put\n",
      "in a barrel which is studded inside with pointed nails, and two white\n",
      "horses should be harnessed to it, to drag her along through one street\n",
      "after another, till she is dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is you,” said the old King, “and you have pronounced your own\n",

      "\n",
      "Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds,\n",

      "\n",
      "Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a\n",

      "But as he approached the tree, a Lion leapt from beneath it, shook\n",

      "Then the man said, “I did not know that the bird belonged to you. I\n",
      "will make amends for the wrong I have done, and ransom myself with a\n",
      "large sum of money, only spare my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lion said, “Nothing can save you, unless you will promise to give\n",

      "will do that, I will grant you your life, and you shall have the bird\n",
      "for your daughter, into the bargain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man hesitated and said, “That might be my youngest daughter, she\n",

      "\n",
      "The servant, however, was terrified and said, “Why should your daughter\n",
      "be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the man allowed himself to be persuaded, took the Singing, Soaring\n",

      "his return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was\n",
      "no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up,\n",
      "kissed and embraced him. When she saw that he had brought with him a\n",
      "Singing, Soaring Lark, she was beside herself with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said,\n",
      "“My dearest Child, I have bought the little bird at a great cost! In\n",
      "return for it, I have been obliged to promise you to a savage Lion.\n",
      "When he has you he will tear you in pieces and devour you,” and he told\n",
      "her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go thither,\n",
      "come what might.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she consoled him and said, “Dearest Father, indeed your promise\n",
      "must be fulfilled. I will go thither and soften the Lion, so that I may\n",
      "return to you safely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went\n",
      "fearlessly out into the forest. The Lion, however, was an enchanted\n",
      "Prince and was by day a Lion, and all his people were Lions with him.\n",
      "But in the night, they resumed their natural human shapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her arrival, she was kindly received and led into the castle. When\n",
      "night came, the Lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding\n",
      "was celebrated with great magnificence. They lived happily together,\n",
      "remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, he came and said, “To-morrow there is a feast in your father’s\n",
      "house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if you are\n",
      "inclined to go there, my Lions shall conduct you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said, “Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,” and\n",
      "went thither, accompanied by the Lions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that\n",
      "she had been torn in pieces by the Lion, and had long ceased to live.\n",
      "But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she\n",
      "was. She remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then\n",
      "went back again to the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again\n",
      "invited to the wedding, she said to the Lion, “This time, I will not go\n",
      "alone. You must come with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if a ray\n",
      "from a burning candle should fall on him, he would be changed into a\n",
      "Dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the Doves.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said, “Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of you and\n",
      "guard you from all light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went away together, and took with them their little child as\n",
      "well. She had a chamber built, so strong and thick that no ray could\n",
      "pierce through it. In this he was to shut himself up when the candles\n",
      "were lit for the wedding-feast. But the door was made of green wood\n",
      "which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding was celebrated with magnificence; but when the procession\n",
      "with all its candles and torches came back from church and passed by\n",
      "this apartment, a ray about the breadth of a hair fell on the King’s\n",
      "Son. When this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant. And\n",
      "when she came in, and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white\n",
      "Dove was sitting there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dove said to her, “For seven years must I fly about the world, but\n",
      "at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood\n",
      "and a white feather. These will show you the way. If you follow the\n",
      "trace you can release me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the Dove flew out at the door, and she followed him. At every\n",
      "seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down,\n",
      "and showed her the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she went continually farther and farther, in the wide world, never\n",
      "looking about her nor resting, and the seven years were almost past.\n",
      "Then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and\n",
      "yet they were so far from it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no\n",
      "drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the Dove had\n",
      "disappeared. And as she thought to herself, “In this no man can help\n",
      "me,” she climbed up to the Sun, and said to him, “You shine into every\n",
      "crevice, and over every peak, have you not seen a white Dove flying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Sun, “I have seen none, but I present you with a casket.\n",
      "Open it when you are in sorest need.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she thanked the Sun, and went on until evening came and the Moon\n",
      "appeared. She then asked her, “You shine the whole night through, and\n",
      "on every field and forest, have you not seen a white Dove flying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Moon, “I have seen no Dove, but here I give you an egg.\n",
      "Break it when you are in great need.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She thanked the Moon, and went on until the Night Wind came up and blew\n",
      "on her, then she said to it, “You blow over every tree and under every\n",
      "leaf, have you not seen a white Dove flying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Night Wind, “I have seen none, but I will ask the three\n",
      "other Winds; perhaps they have seen it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The East Wind and the West Wind came, and had seen nothing, but the\n",
      "South Wind said, “I have seen the white Dove, it has flown to the Red\n",
      "Sea, there it has become a Lion again, for the seven years are over.\n",
      "The Lion is there fighting with a Dragon. The Dragon, however, is an\n",
      "enchanted Princess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Night Wind then said to her, “I will advise you. Go to the Red\n",
      "Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the\n",
      "eleventh, and strike the Dragon with it. Then the Lion will be able\n",
      "to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form. After that,\n",
      "look round and you will see the Griffin which is by the Red Sea. Swing\n",
      "yourself with your beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you\n",
      "over the sea to your own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is a nut for you, when you are above the centre of the sea, let\n",
      "the nut fall. It will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will\n",
      "grow out of the water on which the Griffin may rest; for if he cannot\n",
      "rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across. If you forget\n",
      "to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she went thither, and found everything as the Night Wind had said.\n",
      "She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the\n",
      "Dragon with it, whereupon the Lion overcame it. Immediately both of\n",
      "them regained their human shapes. But when the Princess, who had been\n",
      "the Dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the\n",
      "arm, seated herself on the Griffin, and carried him off with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There stood the poor maiden, who had wandered so far and was again\n",
      "forsaken! She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and\n",
      "said, “Still I will go as far as the Wind blows and as long as the cock\n",
      "crows, until I find him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the\n",
      "castle, where both of them were living together. There she heard that a\n",
      "feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but\n",
      "she said, “God still helps me,” and opened the casket that the Sun had\n",
      "given her. A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and\n",
      "every one, even the Bride, looked at her with astonishment. The\n",
      "dress pleased the Bride so well that she thought it might do for her\n",
      "wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for money or land,” answered she, “but for flesh and blood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bride asked her what she meant by that, then she said, “Let me\n",
      "sleep a night in the chamber where the Bridegroom sleeps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress. At last\n",
      "she consented, but the page was to give the Prince a sleeping-draught.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was night, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into\n",
      "the chamber. She seated herself on the bed and said, “I have followed\n",
      "you for seven years. I have been to the Sun and the Moon, and the\n",
      "Four Winds, and have inquired for you and have helped you against the\n",
      "Dragon. Will you, then, forget me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the\n",
      "wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees. When therefore day broke,\n",
      "she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress. And as that\n",
      "had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down\n",
      "there, and wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the Moon had\n",
      "given her. She opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve\n",
      "chickens all of gold. They ran about chirping, and crept again under\n",
      "the old hen’s wings. Nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world!\n",
      "\n",
      "She arose, and drove them through the meadow. The Bride looked out of\n",
      "the window, and the little chickens pleased her so that she came down\n",
      "and asked if they were for sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood. Let me sleep again in\n",
      "the chamber where the Bridegroom sleeps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bride said, “Yes,” intending to cheat her as on the former evening.\n",
      "But when the Prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring\n",
      "and rustling in the night had been. On this the page told all; that he\n",
      "had been forced to give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had\n",
      "slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince said, “Pour out the draught by the bedside.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill\n",
      "all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by\n",
      "her voice, sprang up and cried, “Now I really am released! I have been\n",
      "as it were in a dream, for the strange Princess has bewitched me so\n",
      "that I have been compelled to forget you! But God has delivered me from\n",
      "the spell at the right time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared\n",
      "the father of the Princess, who was a sorcerer. They seated themselves\n",
      "on the Griffin which bore them across the Red Sea. When they were in\n",
      "the midst of it, she let fall the nut. Immediately a tall nut-tree grew\n",
      "up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they\n",
      "found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they lived thenceforth happily until their death.\n",
      "\n",

      "There was once on a time, a poor peasant called Crab, who drove two\n",
      "oxen with a load of wood to town, and sold it to a doctor for two\n",
      "dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the\n",
      "doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how daintily he\n",
      "ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and he would willingly\n",
      "have been a doctor. So he remained standing a while, and at length\n",
      "inquired if he, too, could not be a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes,” said the doctor, “that is soon managed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What must I do?” asked the peasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the first place, buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has\n",
      "a cock on the frontispiece. In the second, turn your cart and your two\n",
      "oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else\n",
      "pertains to medicine. Thirdly, have a sign painted with the words, ‘I\n",
      "am Doctor Knowall,’ and have that nailed up above your house-door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had\n",
      "doctored people a while, but not long, a rich and great lord had some\n",
      "money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such\n",
      "and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the\n",
      "lord had the horses put in his carriage, drove out to the village, and\n",
      "asked Crab if he were Doctor Knowall?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he was, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, but Grethe, my wife, must go too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in the carriage.\n",
      "They all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman’s castle,\n",
      "the table was spread, and Crab was told to sit down and eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but my wife, Grethe, too,” said he, and he seated himself with\n",
      "her at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the\n",
      "peasant nudged his wife, and said, “Grethe, that was the first,”\n",
      "meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say, “That is the\n",
      "first thief,” and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to\n",
      "his comrade outside, “The doctor knows all! we shall fare badly; he\n",
      "said I was the first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second did not want to go in at all, but was obliged to. So when he\n",
      "went in, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, “Grethe, that is the\n",
      "second.” This servant was so frightened, that he got out.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the third, it did not fare any better, for the peasant said again,\n",
      "“Grethe, that is the third.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth had to carry in a covered dish. In it were crabs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The lord told the doctor that he must show his skill by guessing what\n",
      "was under the cover. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what\n",
      "was in it, and cried out, “Alas! poor Crab!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the lord heard that, he cried, “There! he knows who has the money!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this, the servants were terribly anxious. They winked at the doctor\n",
      "to come out to them. When he went out, they all four confessed that\n",
      "they had stolen the money, and that they were willing to restore it.\n",
      "They led him to the spot where it was hidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the lord got back his wealth, and Doctor Knowall received a large\n",
      "reward and became a famous man.\n",

      "There was once on a time, a soldier who for many years had served the\n",

      "longer because of the many wounds which he had received.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said to him, “You may return to your home, I need you no\n",
      "longer. You will not receive any more money, for only he receives wages\n",
      "who renders me service for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly\n",
      "troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a\n",
      "forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went toward,\n",
      "and came to a house wherein lived a Witch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do give me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,” said\n",

      "“Oho!” she answered, “who gives anything to a runaway soldier? Yet will\n",
      "I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you wish?” said the soldier.\n",

      "“That you should dig all round my garden for me, to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but\n",
      "could not finish it by the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see well enough,” said the Witch, “that you can do no more to-day.\n",
      "But I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must\n",
      "to-morrow chop me a load of wood, and make it small.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the\n",
      "Witch proposed that he should stay one night more. “To-morrow, you\n",
      "shall do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an\n",
      "old, dry well, into which my light has fallen. It burns blue, and never\n",
      "goes out, and you shall bring it up again for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day, the Old Woman took him to the well, and let him down in a\n",
      "basket. He found the Blue Light, and made her a signal to draw him\n",
      "up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she\n",
      "stretched down her hand and wanted to take the Blue Light away from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he, perceiving her evil intention, “I will not give you the\n",
      "light, until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Witch fell into a passion, let him down again into the well, and\n",
      "went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the\n",
      "Blue Light went on burning. But of what use was that to him? He\n",
      "saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while\n",
      "very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his\n",
      "pipe, which was still half full of tobacco. “This shall be my last\n",
      "pleasure,” thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the Blue Light and\n",
      "began to smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little Black\n",
      "Man stood before him, and said, “Master, what are your commands?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What commands have I to give you?” replied the soldier, quite\n",
      "astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must do everything you bid me,” said the Little Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good,” said the soldier; “then in the first place help me out of this\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Little Man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground\n",
      "passage, but the soldier did not forget to take the Blue Light with\n",
      "him. On the way the Little Man showed him treasures hidden there, and\n",
      "the soldier took as much gold as he could carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was above, he said to the Little Man, “Now go and bind the old\n",

      "\n",
      "In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift\n",
      "as the wind, on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the\n",
      "Little Man reappeared. “It is all done,” said he, “and the Witch is\n",
      "already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?”\n",
      "inquired the Little Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this moment, none,” answered the soldier; “you may return home.\n",

      "“Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the\n",
      "Blue Light, and I will appear before you at once.” Thereupon he\n",
      "vanished from sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier returned to the town from which he had come. He went to the\n",
      "best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\n",
      "furnish him a room as magnificent as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he\n",
      "summoned the Little Black Man and said, “I have served the King\n",
      "faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I\n",
      "want to punish him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What am I to do?” asked the Little Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Late at night, when the King’s Daughter is in bed, bring her here in\n",
      "her sleep; she shall do servant’s work for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Little Man said, “That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\n",
      "dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the Little\n",
      "Man carried in the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha! are you there?” cried the soldier, “get to your work at once!\n",
      "Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair. Then he\n",
      "stretched out his feet and said, “Pull off my boots for me,” and made\n",
      "her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently\n",
      "and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the Little Man\n",
      "carried her back to the royal Palace, and laid her in her bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, when the Princess arose, she went to her father, and told\n",
      "him that she had had a very strange dream. “I was carried through the\n",
      "streets with the rapidity of lightning,” said she, “and taken into a\n",
      "soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\n",
      "room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\n",
      "dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dream may have been true,” said the King. “I will give you a piece\n",
      "of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it,\n",
      "and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a\n",
      "track in the streets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But unseen by the King, the Little Man was standing beside him when\n",
      "he said that, and heard all. At night, when the sleeping Princess was\n",
      "again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of\n",
      "her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty Little Man had just\n",
      "before scattered peas in every other street. And again the Princess was\n",
      "compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, the King sent his people out to seek the track, but\n",
      "it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting,\n",
      "picking up peas, and saying, “It must have rained peas, last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must think of something else,” said the King; “keep your shoes on\n",
      "when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you\n",
      "are taken, hide one of them there. I will soon find it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Little Black Man heard this plot, and at night when the soldier\n",
      "again ordered him to bring the Princess, revealed it to him, and told\n",
      "him that he knew of no way to overcome this stratagem, and that if the\n",
      "shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do what I bid you,” replied the soldier. And again this third night,\n",
      "the Princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went\n",
      "away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, the King had the entire town searched for his daughter’s\n",
      "shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at\n",
      "the entreaty of the Little Man, had gone outside the city-gate, was\n",
      "soon brought back, and thrown into prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the\n",
      "Blue Light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now\n",
      "loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when\n",
      "he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up,\n",
      "said to him, “Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left\n",
      "lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the\n",
      "soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the Little\n",
      "Black Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have no fear,” said the latter to his master. “Go wheresoever they\n",
      "take you, and let them do what they will, only take the Blue Light with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked,\n",
      "the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he\n",
      "begged a last favor of the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” asked the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may smoke three,” answered the King, “but do not imagine that I\n",
      "will spare your life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the Blue Light.\n",
      "And as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended the Little Man was\n",
      "there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, “What does my lord\n",
      "command?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and\n",
      "spare not the King who has treated me so ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Little Man fell on them like lightning, darting this way and\n",
      "that, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth,\n",
      "and did not venture to stir again. The King was terrified; he threw\n",
      "himself on the soldier’s mercy, and begged merely to be allowed to\n",
      "live. He gave him his kingdom for his own, and the Princess to wife.\n",

      "There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still\n",
      "a little child. All alone, in a small house at the end of the village,\n",
      "dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and\n",
      "sewing. The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her\n",
      "to her work, and educated her in all that is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girl was fifteen, the old woman became ill, called the child\n",
      "to her bedside, and said, “Dear Daughter, I feel my end drawing near.\n",
      "I leave you the little house, which will protect you from wind and\n",
      "weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which you can earn\n",
      "your bread.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she laid her hands on the girl’s head, blessed her, and said,\n",
      "“Only preserve the love of God in your heart, and all will go well with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the\n",
      "maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last\n",
      "mark of respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was\n",
      "industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good\n",
      "old woman was on all that she did. It seemed as if the flax in the room\n",
      "increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth\n",
      "or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid\n",
      "her amply for it. So that she was in want of nothing, and even had\n",
      "something to share with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time, the Son of the King was traveling about the country\n",
      "looking for a Bride. He was not to choose a poor one, and did not\n",
      "want to have a rich one. So he said, “She shall be my wife who is the\n",
      "poorest, and at the same time the richest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he\n",
      "did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in\n",
      "the place? They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was\n",
      "the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rich girl was sitting in all her splendor before the door of her\n",
      "house, and when the Prince approached her, she got up, went to meet\n",
      "him, and made him a low curtsey. He looked at her, said nothing, and\n",
      "rode on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at\n",
      "the door, but sitting in her little room. He stopped his horse, and\n",
      "saw, through the window on which the bright sun was shining, the girl\n",
      "sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning. She looked up, and when\n",
      "she saw that the Prince was gazing in, blushed all over her face, let\n",
      "her eyes fall, and went on spinning. I do not know whether, just at\n",
      "that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until\n",
      "the King’s Son had ridden away again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she stepped to the window, opened it, and said, “It is so warm in\n",
      "this room!” but she still looked after him as long as she could see the\n",
      "white feathers in his hat. Then she sat down to work again in her own\n",
      "room and went on with her spinning. And a saying which the old woman\n",
      "had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her\n",
      "mind, and she sang these words to herself:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Spindle, my Spindle, haste, haste thee away,\n",
      "      Here to my house bring the wooer, I pray._”\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do you think happened? The spindle sprang out of her hand in\n",
      "an instant, and out of the door. And when, in her astonishment, she got\n",
      "up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into\n",
      "the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it. Before\n",
      "long, it had entirely vanished from her sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver’s shuttle in her\n",
      "hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spindle, however, danced continually onward, and just as the thread\n",
      "came to an end, reached the Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I see?” he cried; “the spindle certainly wants to show me the\n",
      "way!” He turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.\n",
      "The girl was, however, sitting at her work singing:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Shuttle, my Shuttle, weave well this day,\n",
      "      And guide the wooer to me, I pray._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.\n",
      "Before the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which was\n",
      "more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld. Lilies and\n",
      "roses blossomed on both sides of it. And on a golden ground in the\n",
      "centre green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits.\n",
      "Stags and deer stretched their heads in between them. Brightly-colored\n",
      "birds were sitting in the branches above. They lacked nothing but the\n",
      "gift of song. The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything\n",
      "seemed to grow of its own accord.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew. She held the\n",
      "needle in her hand and sang:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Needle, my Needle, sharp-pointed and fine,\n",
      "      Prepare for a wooer this house of mine._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about\n",
      "the room as quick as lightning. It was just as if invisible spirits\n",
      "were working. They covered tables and benches with green cloth in an\n",
      "instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken\n",
      "curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch, than the maiden saw\n",
      "through the window the white feathers of the Prince, whom the spindle\n",
      "had brought thither by the golden thread. He alighted, stepped over the\n",
      "carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the\n",
      "maiden in her poor garments, but she shone out from them like a rose\n",
      "surrounded by leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are the poorest and also the richest,” said he to her. “Come with\n",
      "me, you shall be my Bride.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not speak, but she gave him her hand. Then he kissed her, and\n",
      "led her forth, lifted her on to his horse, and took her to the royal\n",
      "castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the\n",

      "A father once called his three sons before him. He gave to the first a\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am old,” said he, “my death is nigh, and I have wished to take\n",
      "thought for you before my end. Money I have not, and what I now give\n",
      "you seems of little worth. But all depends on your making a sensible\n",
      "use of it. Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown,\n",
      "and your fortune is made.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After the father’s death, the eldest went away with his cock. But\n",
      "wherever he came the cock was already known. In the towns, he saw him\n",
      "from a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round with\n",
      "the wind; and in the villages he heard more than one crowing. No one\n",
      "would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as if he\n",
      "would make his fortune by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the\n",
      "people knew nothing about cocks, and did not even understand how to\n",
      "tell time. They certainly knew when it was morning or evening. But\n",
      "at night, if they did not sleep through it, not one of them knew how to\n",
      "find out the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” said he, “what a proud creature! It has a ruby-red crown upon\n",
      "its head, and wears spurs like a knight. It calls you three times\n",
      "during the night, at fixed hours; and when it calls for the last time,\n",
      "the sun soon after rises. But if it crows by broad daylight, then take\n",
      "notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The people were well pleased. For a whole night they did not sleep, and\n",
      "listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six o’clock,\n",
      "loudly and clearly proclaimed the time. They asked if the creature were\n",
      "for sale, and how much he wanted for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About as much gold as an ass can carry,” answered he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature!” they cried\n",
      "all together, and willingly gave him what he had asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came home with his wealth, his brothers were astonished, and\n",
      "the second said, “Well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get\n",
      "rid of my scythe as profitably.” But it did not look as if he would,\n",
      "for laborers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their\n",
      "shoulders as well as he.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew\n",
      "nothing of scythes. When the corn was ripe, they took cannon out to\n",
      "the fields and shot it down. Now this was rather an uncertain affair.\n",
      "Many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the stems and\n",
      "shot them away, whereby much was lost; and besides all this it made a\n",
      "terrible noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the man set to work and mowed it down so quietly and quickly that\n",
      "the people opened their mouths with astonishment. They agreed to give\n",
      "him what he wanted for the scythe, and he received a horse laden with\n",
      "as much gold as it could carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man. He\n",
      "fared just like the others. So long as he stayed on the mainland, there\n",
      "was nothing to be done. Every place had cats, and there were so many of\n",
      "them that most new-born kittens were drowned in the ponds.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, he sailed to an island, and it luckily happened that no cats\n",
      "had ever yet been seen there, and that the mice had got the upper\n",
      "hand so much, that they danced upon the tables and benches whether\n",
      "the master were at home or not. The people complained bitterly of the\n",
      "plague. The King himself, in his palace, did not know how to secure\n",
      "himself against them. Mice squeaked in every corner, and gnawed\n",
      "whatever they could lay hold of with their teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now the cat began her chase, and soon cleared a couple of rooms,\n",
      "and the people begged the King to buy the wonderful beast for the\n",
      "country. The King willingly gave what was asked, which was a mule laden\n",
      "with gold; and the third brother came home with the greatest treasure\n",
      "of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat made merry with the mice in the royal palace, and killed so\n",
      "many that they could not be counted. At last she grew warm with the\n",
      "work and thirsty, so she stood still, lifted up her head and cried,\n",
      "“Mew! mew!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they heard this strange cry, the King and all his people were\n",
      "frightened, and in their terror ran out of the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King took counsel what was best to be done. At last, it was\n",
      "decided to send a herald to the cat, and command her to leave the\n",
      "palace; if not, she was to expect that force would be used against her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The councilors said, “We would rather be plagued with mice to which\n",

      "\n",
      "A noble youth, therefore, was sent to ask the cat whether she “would\n",

      "greater, answered again, “Mew! Mew!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth thought that she said, “Most certainly not! Most certainly\n",
      "not!” and took this answer to the King.\n",

      "“Then,” said the councilors, “she must yield to force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannon were brought out, and the palace was soon in flames. When the\n",
      "fire reached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out\n",

      "The huntsman thanked the Wise Woman, and thought to himself, “Those are\n",
      "fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the\n",
      "branches above him a screaming and twittering. He looked up and saw a\n",
      "crowd of birds, who were tearing a piece of cloth with their beaks and\n",
      "claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the huntsman, “this is wonderful. It has come to pass just\n",
      "as the old wife foretold!” and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed\n",
      "and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped\n",
      "down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time. Then the huntsman did\n",
      "as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart,\n",
      "swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him. He wished to\n",
      "see if it also had been fulfilled. When he lifted up the pillow, the\n",
      "gold piece shone in his eyes. The next day, he found another, and so\n",
      "it went on, every time he got up. He gathered together a heap of gold,\n",
      "but at last he thought, “Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at\n",
      "home? I will go forth and see the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman’s pouch and\n",
      "gun, and went out into the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that one day he traveled through a dense forest, and\n",
      "when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him was a fine\n",
      "castle. An Old Woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden,\n",
      "looking out of one of the windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman, however, was a Witch and said to the maiden, “There\n",
      "comes a man out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his\n",
      "body. We must filch it from him, my dear Daughter. It is more suitable\n",
      "for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart about him, by means of which\n",
      "every morning, a gold piece lies under his pillow.” She told her what\n",
      "she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally\n",
      "threatened her, and said with angry eyes, “And if you do not attend to\n",
      "what I say, it will be the worse for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to\n",
      "himself, “I have traveled about for such a long time, I will take a\n",
      "rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle. I have certainly money\n",
      "enough.” Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of\n",
      "the pretty maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "He entered the house, and was well received and courteously\n",
      "entertained. Before long, he was so much in love with the young Witch\n",
      "that he no longer thought of anything else, and saw things as she saw\n",
      "them, and did what she desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman then said, “Now we must have the bird’s heart, he will\n",
      "never miss it.” She prepared a drink, and when it was ready, poured\n",
      "it into a cup and gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the\n",
      "huntsman.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did so, saying, “Now, my Dearest, drink to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took the cup, and when he had swallowed the draught, he brought\n",
      "up the heart of the bird. The girl had to take it away secretly and\n",
      "swallow it herself, for the Old Woman would have it so. Thenceforward\n",
      "he found no more gold under his pillow. But it lay instead under that\n",
      "of the maiden, from whence the Old Woman fetched it away every morning.\n",
      "But he was so much in love and so befooled, that he thought of nothing\n",
      "else but of passing his time with the maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old Witch said, “We have the bird’s heart, but we must also\n",
      "take the Wishing-Cloak away from him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden answered, “We will leave him that; he has lost his wealth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman was angry and said, “Such a mantle is a wonderful thing,\n",
      "and is seldom to be found in this world. I must and will have it!” She\n",
      "gave the maiden several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it\n",
      "should fare ill with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she did the Old Woman’s bidding, placed herself at the window and\n",
      "looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman asked, “Why do you stand there so sorrowfully?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, my Beloved,” was her answer, “over yonder lies the Garnet\n",
      "Mountain, where the precious stones grow. I long for them so much that\n",
      "when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them? Only the\n",
      "birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you nothing else to complain of?” said the huntsman. “I will soon\n",
      "remove that burden from your heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet\n",
      "Mountain. In the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together.\n",
      "Precious stones were glistening on every side, so that it was a joy to\n",
      "see them. Together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Old Woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes\n",
      "of the huntsman should become heavy. He said to the maiden, “We will\n",
      "sit down and rest a while. I am so tired, that I can no longer stand on\n",
      "my feet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep.\n",
      "When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and\n",
      "wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished\n",
      "herself back at home with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the huntsman had had his sleep out, he awoke, and perceived\n",
      "that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild\n",
      "mountain. Then he said, “Oh, what treachery there is in the world!” and\n",
      "sat there in care and sorrow, not knowing what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous Giants, who dwelt\n",
      "thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long, before he\n",
      "saw three of them coming toward him. The Giants came up, and the first\n",
      "kicked him with his foot and said, “What sort of an earthworm is lying\n",
      "curled up here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second said, “Step upon him and kill him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the third said, “Would that be worth your while? Let him live, he\n",
      "cannot remain here. When he climbs higher, toward the summit of the\n",
      "mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him and bear him away.” So saying\n",
      "they passed by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Huntsman had paid heed to their words, and as soon as they\n",
      "were gone, he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain.\n",
      "And when he had sat there a while, a cloud floated toward him,\n",
      "caught him up, carried him away, and traveled about for a long time\n",
      "in the heavens. Then it sank lower, and let itself down on a great\n",
      "cabbage-garden, girt round by walls, so that he came softly to the\n",
      "ground on cabbages and vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the huntsman looked about him, and said, “If I only had something\n",
      "to eat! I am so hungry, and my hunger will grow greater. But I see here\n",
      "neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort of fruit, everywhere there\n",
      "is nothing but cabbages.” At length he thought, “At a pinch I can eat\n",
      "some of the leaves. They do not taste particularly good, but they will\n",
      "refresh me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he picked himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it. But\n",
      "scarcely had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, when wonderful! he\n",
      "felt quite changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four legs grew on him, a large head and two thick ears; and he saw with\n",
      "horror that he was changed into a Donkey. Still as his hunger became\n",
      "greater every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his\n",
      "present nature, he went on eating with great zest. At last he arrived\n",
      "at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had swallowed it, he\n",
      "again felt a change, and resumed his human shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the huntsman lay down, and slept off his fatigue. When he awoke\n",
      "next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of\n",
      "the good ones, and thought to himself, “This shall help me to get my\n",
      "own again and punish treachery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he took the cabbages with him, climbed over the wall, and went\n",
      "forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart.\n",
      "\n",
      "After wandering about for a couple of days, he was lucky enough to find\n",
      "it again. He dyed his face brown, so that his own mother would not have\n",
      "known him; and begged for shelter. “I am so tired,” said he, “that I\n",
      "can go no further.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Witch asked, “Who are you, Countryman, and what is your business?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Said he, “I have been so fortunate as to find the most wonderful salad\n",
      "which grows under the sun, and am carrying it about with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Old Woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and\n",
      "said, “Dear Countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” answered he, “I have brought two heads with me, and will\n",
      "give you one of them,” and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad\n",
      "cabbage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this\n",
      "new dish, that she herself went into the kitchen and prepared it. When\n",
      "it was ready she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took\n",
      "a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth. Hardly had she\n",
      "swallowed them, than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran\n",
      "out into the courtyard in the form of a Donkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing\n",
      "there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up. But on the way,\n",
      "according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate\n",
      "a couple of leaves. Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she\n",
      "likewise became a Donkey, and ran out to the Old Woman. And the dish\n",
      "of salad fell to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime the huntsman sat beside the beautiful maiden, and as no one\n",
      "came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, “I don’t\n",
      "know what has become of the salad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman thought, “The salad must have already taken effect,” and\n",
      "said, “I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he went down he saw the two Donkeys running about in the courtyard.\n",
      "The salad, however, was lying on the ground. “All right,” said he, “the\n",
      "two have taken their portion,” and he picked up the other leaves, laid\n",
      "them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden. “I bring you the\n",
      "delicate food myself,” said he, “in order that you may not have to wait\n",
      "longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of\n",
      "her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of a Donkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones\n",
      "could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said,\n",
      "“Now you shall receive the wages of your treachery,” and bound them\n",
      "together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came\n",
      "to a mill.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head, and asked what\n",
      "he wanted. “I have three unmanageable beasts,” answered he, “which I\n",
      "don’t want to keep any longer. Will you take them in, and give them\n",
      "food and stable room, and manage them as I tell you? Then I will pay\n",
      "you what you ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The miller said, “Why not? But how am I to manage them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings and one\n",
      "meal daily to the old Donkey, and that was the Witch; one beating and\n",
      "three meals to the younger one, which was the servant-girl; and to the\n",
      "youngest, which was the maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he\n",
      "could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten. After that he went\n",
      "back into the castle, and found therein everything he needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him\n",
      "that the old Donkey which had received three beatings and only one\n",
      "meal daily, was dead; “the two others,” he continued, “are certainly\n",
      "not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they\n",
      "cannot last much longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller\n",
      "to drive them back again to him. And when they came, he gave them some\n",
      "of the good salad, so that they became human again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beautiful maiden fell on her knees before him, and said, “Ah, my\n",
      "Beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you. My mother drove\n",
      "me to it. It was done against my will, for I love you dearly. Your\n",
      "Wishing-Cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the Bird’s-Heart I will\n",
      "take a potion and bring it up again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he thought otherwise, and said, “Keep it. It is all the same, for I\n",
      "will take you for my true wife.”\n",

      "\n",
      "They, however, still had a swineherd’s daughter, who was even prettier\n",
      "than the miller’s daughter, and they determined to give her a piece\n",
      "of gold to go to the Iron Stove, instead of the King’s Daughter. So\n",
      "she was taken thither, and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty\n",
      "hours. She, likewise, made nothing of it.\n",

      "the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron gave way, and\n",

      "and with precious jewels, that her very soul was delighted. Therefore,\n",
      "she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that he was able to\n",
      "get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said he, “You are mine, and I am yours. You are my Bride, and have\n",

      "\n",
      "He wanted to take her away with him to his kingdom, but she entreated\n",
      "him to let her go once again to her father. The King’s Son allowed her\n",
      "to do so, but she was not to say more to her father than three words,\n",
      "and then she was to come back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she went home, but she spoke more than three words, and instantly\n",
      "the Iron Stove disappeared, and was taken far away over glass mountains\n",

      "shut up in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, she bade good-bye to her father, took some money with her,\n",
      "but not much, and went back to the great forest, and looked for the\n",
      "Iron Stove, but it was nowhere to be found. For nine days she sought\n",
      "it. Then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do, for\n",
      "she could no longer live.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up\n",
      "her mind to spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts.\n",
      "When midnight drew near, she saw in the distance a small light, and\n",
      "thought, “Ah, there I may be saved!” She got down from the tree, and\n",
      "went toward the light, and on the way she prayed. Then she came to a\n",
      "little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a small\n",
      "heap of wood lay in front of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought, “Ah, whither have I come!” and peeped in through the\n",
      "window. But she saw nothing inside but Toads, big and little, except a\n",
      "table covered with wine and roast meat, while the plates and glasses\n",
      "were of silver. Then she took courage, and knocked at the door. The fat\n",
      "Toad cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Little green Waiting-Maid,\n",
      "      Waiting-Maid with the limping leg,\n",
      "      Little Dog of the limping leg,\n",
      "      Hop hither and thither,\n",
      "      And quickly see who is without!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and a small Toad came along and opened the door to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When she entered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to\n",
      "sit down. They asked, “Where have you come from, and whither are you\n",
      "going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had\n",
      "disobeyed the order which had been given her not to say more than three\n",
      "words, the stove, and the King’s Son also, had disappeared, and now she\n",
      "was seeking him over hill and dale until she found him. At that, the\n",
      "old fat one said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Little green Waiting-Maid,\n",
      "      Waiting-Maid with the limping leg,\n",
      "      Little Dog of the limping leg,\n",
      "      Hop hither and thither,\n",
      "      And bring me the great box._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the little one went and brought the box. After this they gave her\n",
      "meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like silk\n",
      "and velvet. She laid herself therein, in God’s name, and slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "When morning came she arose, and the old Toad gave her three needles\n",
      "out of the great box, which she was to take with her; they would be\n",
      "needed by her, for she had to cross a high Glass Mountain, and go\n",
      "over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all this, she\n",
      "would get her lover back again. Then she gave her three things, which\n",
      "she was to take the greatest care of, namely, three large needles, a\n",
      "plough-wheel, and three nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these she traveled onwards, and when she came to the Glass\n",
      "Mountain, which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first\n",
      "behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it. And when\n",
      "she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully.\n",
      "After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated\n",
      "herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them. At last she arrived\n",
      "in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a\n",
      "large and beautiful castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went in and asked for a place. She knew, however, that the King’s\n",
      "Son whom she had released from the Iron Stove in the great forest, was\n",
      "in the castle. Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages. But,\n",
      "already the King’s Son had another maiden by his side, whom he wanted\n",
      "to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her\n",
      "pocket and found the three nuts which the old Toad had given her. She\n",
      "cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel, when, lo\n",
      "and behold, there was a stately royal garment in it! But when the Bride\n",
      "heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to buy it,\n",
      "and said, “It is not a dress for a servant-girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said, no, she would not sell it, but if the Bride would grant her\n",
      "one thing she should have it, and that was, leave to sleep one night\n",
      "in her Bridegroom’s chamber. The Bride gave her permission because the\n",
      "dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was evening, she said to her Bridegroom, “That silly girl will\n",
      "sleep in your room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are willing so am I,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "She, however, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a\n",
      "sleeping-draught. So the Bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep\n",
      "in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wept the whole night and cried, “I set you free when you were in an\n",
      "Iron Stove in the wild forest. I sought you, and walked over a Glass\n",
      "Mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found you,\n",
      "and yet you will not hear me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants sat by the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the\n",
      "whole night through, and in the morning they told it to their lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the next evening, when she had washed up, she opened the second\n",
      "nut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it. When the Bride\n",
      "beheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take\n",
      "money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the Bridegroom’s\n",
      "chamber. The Bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so\n",
      "soundly that he could hear nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, “I set you\n",
      "free when you were in an Iron Stove in the wild forest. I sought you,\n",
      "and walked over a Glass Mountain, and over three sharp swords and a\n",
      "great lake before I found you, and yet you will not hear me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole\n",
      "night through, and in the morning informed their lord of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the third\n",
      "nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff\n",
      "with pure gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Bride saw that, she wanted to have it, but the maiden gave it\n",
      "up only on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the\n",
      "Bridegroom’s apartment. The King’s Son was, However, on his guard, and\n",
      "threw the sleeping-draught away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, therefore, when she began to weep and to cry, “Dearest Love, I set\n",
      "you free when you were in the Iron Stove in the terrible wild forest,”\n",
      "the King’s Son leapt up and said, “You are the true one, you are mine,\n",
      "and I am yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her,\n",
      "and they took away the false Bride’s clothes so that she could not get\n",
      "up. When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when\n",
      "they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated themselves on\n",
      "the plough-wheel, and when they got to the Glass Mountain they thrust\n",
      "the three needles in it. And so at length they reached the little old\n",
      "house. But when they went inside that, it was a great castle, and the\n",
      "Toads were all disenchanted, and were King’s children, and full of\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the wedding was celebrated, and the King’s Son and the Princess\n",
      "remained in the castle, which was much larger than the castles of their\n",
      "fathers. But, as the old King grieved at being left alone, they fetched\n",
      "him away, and brought him to live with them. And they had two Kingdoms,\n",
      "and lived together happily ever afterward.\n",

      "\n",
      "    “_Boil, Little Pot, boil!_”\n",

      "There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\n",
      "the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which\n",
      "bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like\n",
      "the two rose-trees. One was called Snow-White, and the other Rose-Red.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\n",
      "in the world were, only Snow-White was more quiet and gentle than\n",
      "Rose-Red. Rose-Red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\n",
      "seeking flowers and catching butterflies. But Snow-White sat at home\n",
      "with her mother, and helped her with the housework, or read to her when\n",
      "there was nothing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children were so fond of each other, that they always held each\n",
      "other by the hand when they went out together. When Snow-White said,\n",
      "“We will not leave each other,” Rose-Red answered, “Never so long as we\n",
      "live.” And their mother would add, “What one has, she must share with\n",
      "the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries. Beasts\n",
      "never did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\n",
      "hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\n",
      "their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still\n",
      "upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "No mishap overtook them. If they stayed too late in the forest, and\n",
      "night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the\n",
      "moss, and slept until morning. Their mother knew this, and had no worry\n",
      "on their account.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had\n",
      "roused them, they saw a beautiful Child in a shining white dress\n",
      "sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but\n",
      "said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round,\n",
      "they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and\n",
      "would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness, if they had gone\n",
      "only a few paces farther. And their mother told them that it must have\n",
      "been the Angel who watches over good children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat,\n",
      "that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer, Rose-Red took\n",
      "care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her\n",
      "mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In\n",
      "the winter, Snow-White lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hook.\n",
      "The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it\n",
      "polished.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, “Go,\n",
      "Snow-White, and bolt the door,” and then they sat round the hearth, and\n",
      "the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book. The\n",
      "two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb\n",
      "upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its\n",
      "head hidden beneath its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one\n",
      "knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said,\n",
      "“Quick, Rose-Red, open the door, it must be a traveler who is seeking\n",
      "shelter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose-Red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor\n",
      "man, but it was not. It was a Bear that stretched his broad, black head\n",
      "within the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose-Red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove\n",
      "fluttered, and Snow-White hid herself behind her mother’s bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Bear began to speak and said, “Do not be afraid. I will do you\n",
      "no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire. Only take care\n",
      "that you do not burn your coat.” Then she cried, “Snow-White, Rose-Red,\n",
      "come out, the Bear will do you no harm, he means well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and\n",
      "were not afraid of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bear said, “Here, Children, knock the snow out of my coat a\n",
      "little;” so they brought the broom and swept the Bear’s hide clean.\n",
      "And he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\n",
      "comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with\n",
      "their clumsy guest. They tugged at his hair with their hands, put their\n",
      "feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch\n",
      "and beat him, and, when he growled, they laughed. But the Bear took it\n",
      "all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, “Leave\n",
      "me alive, Children:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Snowy-white, Rosy-red,_\n",
      "      _Will you beat your lover dead?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was bedtime, and the others went to sleep, the mother said to\n",
      "the Bear, “You may lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe\n",
      "from the cold and the bad weather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted\n",
      "across the snow into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henceforth the Bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\n",
      "down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\n",
      "much as they liked. They got so used to him, that the doors were never\n",
      "fastened until their black friend had arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "When spring was come and all outside was green, the Bear said one\n",
      "morning to Snow-White, “Now I must go away, and cannot come back for\n",
      "the whole summer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are you going, then, dear Bear?” asked Snow-White.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\n",
      "Dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\n",
      "to stay below and cannot work their way through. But now, when the sun\n",
      "has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\n",
      "pry and steal. And what once gets into their hands and in their caves,\n",
      "does not easily see daylight again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snow-White was very sorry for his going away. And as she unbolted the\n",
      "door for him, and the Bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\n",
      "and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off. It seemed to Snow-White as\n",
      "if she saw gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The\n",
      "Bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short time afterward, the mother sent her children into the forest\n",
      "to get fire-wood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\n",
      "ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backward and\n",
      "forward in the grass. But they could not make out what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came nearer they saw a Dwarf with an old withered face and\n",
      "a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\n",
      "crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backward and\n",
      "forward like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, “Why do you\n",
      "stand there? Can you not come here and help me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you about there, Little Man?” asked Rose-Red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You stupid, prying goose!” answered the Dwarf; “I was going to split\n",
      "the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that\n",
      "one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs. We do not\n",
      "swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge\n",
      "safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood\n",
      "was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so\n",
      "quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard. So now it\n",
      "is tight in, and I cannot get away. And you silly, sleek, milk-faced\n",
      "things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\n",
      "was caught too fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will run and fetch some one,” said Rose-Red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You senseless goose!” snarled the Dwarf. “Why should you fetch\n",
      "some one? You are already two too many for me. Can you not think of\n",
      "something better?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be impatient,” said Snow-White, “I will help you,” and she\n",
      "pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Dwarf felt himself free, he grabbed a bag which lay\n",
      "amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted\n",
      "it up, grumbling to himself, “Rude people, to cut off a piece of my\n",
      "fine beard! Bad luck to you!” and then he swung the bag upon his back,\n",
      "and went off without even once looking at the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time after that Snow-White and Rose-Red went to catch a dish of\n",
      "fish. As they came near the brook, they saw something like a large\n",
      "grasshopper jumping toward the water, as if it were going to leap in.\n",
      "They ran to it and found it was the Dwarf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are you going?” said Rose-Red; “you surely don’t want to go into\n",
      "the water?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not such a fool!” cried the Dwarf; “don’t you see that the\n",
      "accursed fish wants to pull me in?” The Little Man had been sitting\n",
      "there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the\n",
      "fishing-line. Just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not\n",
      "strength to pull it out. The fish kept the upper hand and was pulling\n",
      "the Dwarf toward him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it\n",
      "was of little good, he was forced to follow the fish, and was in\n",
      "great danger of being dragged into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls came just in time. They held him fast and tried to free his\n",
      "beard from the line. But all in vain, beard and line were entangled\n",
      "fast together. Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut\n",
      "the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Dwarf saw that, he screamed out, “Is that civil, you\n",
      "toadstool, to disfigure one’s face? Was it not enough to clip off the\n",
      "end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot\n",
      "let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the\n",
      "soles off your shoes!” Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in\n",
      "the rushes, and, without saying a word more, he dragged it away and\n",
      "disappeared behind a stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that soon afterward the mother sent the two children to the\n",
      "town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led\n",
      "them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about.\n",
      "They now noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round\n",
      "and round above them. It sank lower and lower, and at last settled near\n",
      "a rock not far off. Directly afterward they heard a loud, piteous cry.\n",
      "They ran up and saw, with horror, that the eagle had seized their old\n",
      "acquaintance the Dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the Little Man,\n",
      "and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Dwarf had recovered from his first fright, he cried\n",
      "with his shrill voice, “Could you not have done it more carefully! You\n",
      "dragged at my brown coat, so that it is all torn and full of holes. You\n",
      "helpless, clumsy creatures!” Then he took up a sack full of precious\n",
      "stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on\n",
      "their way and did their business in the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\n",
      "Dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\n",
      "and had not thought that any one would come there at such a late hour.\n",
      "The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones. They glittered and\n",
      "sparkled with all colors so beautifully, that the children stood still\n",
      "and looked at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you stand gaping there?” cried the Dwarf, and his ashen-gray\n",
      "face became copper-red with rage. He was going on with his bad words,\n",
      "when a loud growling was heard, and a black Bear came trotting toward\n",
      "them out of the forest. The Dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could\n",
      "not get to his cave, for the Bear was already close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the fear of his heart he cried, “Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! I\n",
      "will give you all my treasures! Look, the beautiful jewels lying there!\n",
      "Grant me my life. What do you want with such a slender little fellow\n",
      "as I? You would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two\n",
      "wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails. For\n",
      "mercy’s sake eat them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a\n",
      "single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls had run away, but the Bear called to them, “Snow-White and\n",
      "Rose-Red, do not be afraid. Wait, I will come with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they knew his voice and waited. And when he came up to them,\n",
      "suddenly his bear-skin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man,\n",
      "clothed all in gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a King’s Son,” he said, “and I was bewitched by that wicked\n",
      "Dwarf, who had stolen my treasures. I have had to run about the forest\n",
      "as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\n",
      "well-deserved punishment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snow-White was married to him, and Rose-Red to his brother. They\n",
      "divided between them the great treasure which the Dwarf had gathered\n",
      "together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\n",
      "her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\n",
      "they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\n",
      "roses, white and red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In former days, every sound had its meaning, the birds also had their\n",
      "own language which every one understood. Now it only sounds like\n",
      "chirping, screeching, and whistling, and to some, like music without\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came into the birds’ mind, however, that they would no longer be\n",
      "without a ruler, and would choose one of themselves to be King.\n",
      "\n",
      "One alone amongst them, the green plover, was opposed to this. He had\n",
      "lived free and would die free, and anxiously flying hither and thither,\n",
      "he cried, “Where shall I go? where shall I go?” He retired into a\n",
      "lonely and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself no more among his\n",
      "fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine May morning\n",
      "they all gathered together from the woods and fields: eagles and\n",
      "chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how can I name them\n",
      "all? Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his clerk, who is so called\n",
      "because he is always heard a few days before him, and a very small bird\n",
      "which as yet had no name, mingled with the band.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hen, which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter,\n",
      "was astonished at the great assemblage. “What, what, what is going to\n",
      "be done?” she cackled. But the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said,\n",
      "“Only rich people,” and told her what they had on hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was decided, however, that the one who could fly the highest should\n",
      "be King. A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard\n",
      "that, cried a warning, “No, no, no! no!” because he thought that many\n",
      "tears would be shed because of this. But the crow said, “Caw, caw,” and\n",
      "that all would pass off peaceably.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now determined that, on this fine morning, they should at once\n",
      "begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able to say, “I\n",
      "could easily have flown much higher, but the evening came on, and I\n",
      "could do no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On a given signal, therefore, the whole troop rose up in the air. The\n",
      "dust ascended from the land, and there was tremendous fluttering and\n",
      "whirring and beating of wings. It looked as if a black cloud was rising\n",
      "up. The little birds were, however, soon left behind. They could go no\n",
      "farther, and fell back to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The larger birds held out longer, but none could equal the eagle, who\n",
      "mounted so high that he could have picked the eyes out of the sun. And\n",
      "when he saw that the others could not get up to him, he thought, “Why\n",
      "should I fly any higher, I am the King?” and began to let himself down\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birds beneath him at once cried to him, “You must be our King, no\n",
      "one has flown so high as you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Except me,” screamed the little fellow without a name, who had crept\n",
      "into the breast-feathers of the eagle. And as he was not at all tired,\n",
      "he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself. When,\n",
      "however, he had gone as far as this, he folded his wings together, and\n",
      "called down with clear and penetrating voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “_I am King! I am King!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You, our King?” cried the birds angrily. “You have done this by trick\n",
      "and cunning!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they made another condition. He should be King who could go down\n",
      "lowest in the ground. How the goose did flap about with its broad\n",
      "breast when it was once more on the land! How quickly the cock\n",
      "scratched a hole! The duck came off the worst of all, for she leapt\n",
      "into a ditch, but sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring\n",
      "pond, crying, “Cheating, cheating!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little bird without a name, however, sought out a mouse-hole,\n",
      "slipped down into it, and cried out of it, with his small voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “_I am King! I am King!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You our King!” cried the birds still more angrily. “Do you think your\n",
      "cunning shall prevail?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out.\n",
      "The owl was placed as sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the\n",
      "rascal out if she had any value for her life. When evening was come all\n",
      "the birds were feeling very tired after exerting their wings so much\n",
      "that they went to bed with their wives and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing steadfastly\n",
      "into it with her great eyes. In the meantime she, too, had grown tired\n",
      "and thought to herself, “You might certainly shut one eye, you will\n",
      "still watch with the other, and the little miscreant shall not come out\n",
      "of his hole.” So she shut one eye, and with the other looked straight\n",
      "at the mouse-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip away,\n",
      "but the owl came forward, and he drew his head back. Then the owl\n",
      "opened the one eye again, and shut the other, intending to shut them in\n",
      "turn all through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open the other. And\n",
      "as soon as both her eyes were shut, she fell asleep. The little fellow\n",
      "soon saw that, and slipped away.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by\n",
      "daylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her\n",
      "feathers out. She only flies out by night, but hates and pursues mice\n",
      "because they make such ugly holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little bird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen, because\n",
      "he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught. He steals\n",
      "about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he sometimes cries, “I\n",

      "There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom\n",
      "was called One-Eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her\n",
      "forehead, and the second, Two-Eyes, because she had two eyes like other\n",
      "folks, and the youngest, Three-Eyes, because she had three eyes; and\n",
      "her third eye was in the centre of her forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as Two-Eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and\n",
      "her mother could not endure her. They said to her, “You, with your two\n",
      "eyes, are no better than common folk. You do not belong to us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her\n",

      "to make her unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass that Two-Eyes had to go out into the fields and tend\n",
      "the goat, but she was still very hungry, because her sisters had given\n",
      "her so little to eat. She sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so\n",
      "bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one day, when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing\n",

      "\n",
      "Two-Eyes answered, “Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes\n",

      "me from one corner to another, throw old clothes at me, and give me\n",
      "nothing to eat but the scraps they leave? To-day, they have given me so\n",
      "little that I am still very hungry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Wise Woman said, “Wipe away your tears, Two-Eyes, and I will\n",
      "tell you something to stop your ever suffering from hunger again; just\n",
      "say to your goat:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,\n",
      "      Cover the table with something to eat!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "and then a clean well-spread little table will stand before you, with\n",
      "the most delicious food upon it, of which you may eat as much as you\n",
      "are inclined. And when you have had enough, and have no more need of\n",
      "the little table, just say:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,\n",
      "      And take the table quite away!_’\n",

      "\n",
      "Hereupon the Wise Woman departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Two-Eyes thought, “I must instantly make a trial, and see if what\n",
      "she said is true, for I am far too hungry,” and she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,\n",
      "      Cover the table with something to eat!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with\n",
      "a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife\n",
      "and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there\n",
      "also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Two-Eyes said a little prayer she knew, “Lord God, be with us\n",
      "always, Amen,” and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it. And\n",
      "when she was satisfied, she said, as the Wise Woman had taught her:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,\n",
      "      And take the table quite away!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is a delightful way of keeping house!” thought Two-Eyes, and was\n",
      "quite glad and happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small\n",
      "earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for\n",
      "her, but she did not touch it. Next day, she again went out with her\n",
      "goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to\n",
      "her, lying untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not notice\n",
      "it, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said,\n",
      "“There is something wrong about Two-Eyes, she always leaves her food\n",
      "untasted. She used to eat up everything that was given her. She must\n",
      "have discovered other ways of getting food.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-Eye\n",
      "with Two-Eyes, when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to watch\n",
      "what Two-Eyes did while she was there, and whether any one brought\n",
      "her things to eat and drink. So when Two-Eyes set out the next time,\n",
      "One-Eye went to her and said, “I will go with you to the pasture, and\n",
      "see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is\n",
      "food.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Two-Eyes knew what was in One-Eye’s mind, and drove the goat into\n",
      "high grass and said, “Come, One-Eye, we will sit down, and I will sing\n",
      "something to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One-Eye sat down, and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat\n",
      "of the sun, and Two-Eyes sang constantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_One-Eye, wakest thou?\n",
      "      One-Eye, sleepest thou?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "until One-Eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep. As soon as Two-Eyes\n",
      "saw that One-Eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,\n",
      "      Cover the table with something to eat!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was\n",
      "satisfied. Then she again cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,\n",
      "      And take the table quite away!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and in an instant all was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-Eyes now awakened One-Eye, and said, “One-Eye, you want to take\n",
      "care of the goat, and yet go to sleep while you are doing it! In the\n",
      "meantime, the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went home, and again Two-Eyes let her little dish stand\n",
      "untouched, and One-Eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat\n",
      "it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day, the mother said to Three-Eyes, “This time you shall go and\n",
      "watch if Two-Eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches\n",
      "her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Three-Eyes went to Two-Eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see\n",
      "if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Two-Eyes knew what was in Three-Eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into\n",
      "high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to\n",
      "you, Three-Eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Three-Eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of\n",
      "the sun, and Two-Eyes began the same song as before, and sang:\n",
      "\n",
      "     “_Three-Eyes, are you waking?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "but then, instead of singing,\n",
      "\n",
      "     “_Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang:\n",
      "\n",
      "     “_Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and sang all the time,\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Three-Eyes, are you waking?\n",
      "      Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then two of the eyes which Three-Eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but\n",
      "the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is\n",
      "true that Three-Eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it\n",
      "was asleep too. But it blinked, and could see everything very well. And\n",
      "when Two-Eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her\n",
      "little charm:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,\n",
      "      Cover the table with something to eat!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the\n",
      "table to go away again:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,\n",
      "      And take the table quite away!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "and Three-Eyes had seen everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Two-Eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep,\n",
      "Three-Eyes? You are a good caretaker! Come, we will go home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they got home, Two-Eyes again did not eat, and Three-Eyes said\n",
      "to the mother, “Now, I know why that proud thing there does not eat.\n",
      "When she is out, she says to the goat:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,\n",
      "      Cover the table with something to eat!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of\n",
      "food, much better than any we have here. When she has eaten all she\n",
      "wants, she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "   “‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,\n",
      "      And take the table quite away!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "and all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my\n",
      "eyes to sleep by using a charm, but luckily the one in my forehead kept\n",
      "awake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the envious mother cried, “Do you want to fare better than we do?\n",
      "The desire shall pass away!” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and\n",
      "thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Two-Eyes saw that, full of sorrow, she went outside, and seated\n",
      "herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the Wise Woman once more stood by her side, and said,\n",
      "“Two-Eyes, why are you weeping?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have I not reason to weep?” she answered. “The goat, which covered the\n",
      "table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my\n",
      "mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wise Woman said, “Two-Eyes, I will give you a piece of good advice.\n",
      "Ask your sisters to give you the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and\n",
      "bury them in the ground in front of the house, and your fortune will be\n",
      "made.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she vanished, and Two-Eyes went home and said to her sisters,\n",
      "“Dear Sisters, do give me some part of my goat. I don’t wish for what\n",
      "is good, but give me the entrails.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you may have it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Two-Eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly, at evening, in\n",
      "front of the house-door, as the Wise Woman had counseled her to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there\n",
      "stood a wonderful, magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit\n",
      "of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was\n",
      "nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree\n",
      "could have come there during the night, but Two-Eyes saw that it had\n",
      "grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the\n",
      "exact spot where she had buried them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the mother said to One-Eye, “Climb up, my Child, and gather some\n",
      "of the fruit of the tree for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One-Eye climbed up, but when she was about to lay hold of one of the\n",
      "golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands. And that happened\n",
      "each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what\n",
      "she might.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the mother, “Three-Eyes, do you climb up. You with your three\n",
      "eyes can look about you better than One-Eye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One-Eye slipped down, and Three-Eyes climbed up. Three-Eyes was not\n",
      "more skillful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples\n",
      "always escaped her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could\n",
      "grasp the fruit no better than One-Eye and Three-Eyes, for she always\n",
      "clutched empty air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Two-Eyes, “I will go up, perhaps I may succeed better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters cried, “You, indeed, with your two eyes! What can you do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Two-Eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did not get out of her\n",
      "way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could\n",
      "pluck them one after the other. And she brought a whole apronful down\n",
      "with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating\n",
      "poor Two-Eyes any better for this, she and One-Eye and Three-Eyes were\n",
      "only envious, because Two-Eyes alone had been able to get the fruit.\n",
      "They treated her still more cruelly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so befell that once, when they were all standing together by the\n",
      "tree, a young Knight came up. “Quick, Two-Eyes,” cried the two sisters,\n",
      "“creep under this and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they\n",
      "turned an empty barrel, which was standing close by the tree, over\n",
      "poor Two-Eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been\n",
      "gathering, under it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and\n",
      "admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two\n",
      "sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who will bestow\n",
      "one branch of it on me may, in return for it, ask whatsoever he\n",
      "desires.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then One-Eye and Three-Eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and\n",
      "that they would give him a branch. They both tried very hard, but they\n",
      "were not able to do it, for every time the branches and fruit moved\n",
      "away from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the Knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong\n",
      "to you, and yet you should still not be able to break a piece off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They again insisted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were\n",
      "saying so, Two-Eyes rolled a couple of golden apples from under the\n",
      "barrel to the feet of the Knight, for she was vexed with One-Eye and\n",
      "Three-Eyes, for not speaking the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked from whence\n",
      "they came. One-Eye and Three-Eyes answered that they had another\n",
      "sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes\n",
      "like any common person.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-Eyes, come\n",
      "hither!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Two-Eyes, quite cheered, came from beneath the barrel, and the\n",
      "Knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “You, Two-Eyes, can\n",
      "certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Two-Eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the\n",
      "tree belongs to me.” And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease\n",
      "broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and\n",
      "gave it to the Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the Knight, “Two-Eyes, what shall I give you for it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas!” answered Two-Eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and\n",
      "want, from early morning till late night. If you would take me with\n",
      "you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Knight lifted Two-Eyes on his horse, and took her home with\n",
      "him to his father’s castle. There he gave her beautiful clothes and\n",
      "meat and drink to her heart’s content. And as he loved her so much he\n",
      "married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Two-Eyes was thus carried away by the handsome Knight, her two\n",
      "sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. “The wonderful\n",
      "tree, however, remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can\n",
      "gather no fruit from it, every one will stand still and look at it, and\n",
      "come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store\n",
      "for us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at\n",
      "an end. And when Two-Eyes looked out of the window of her own little\n",
      "room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it. And so it\n",
      "had followed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-Eyes lived a long time in happiness. One day, two poor women came\n",
      "to her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and\n",
      "recognized her sisters, One-Eye, and Three-Eyes, who had fallen into\n",
      "such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from\n",
      "door to door. Two-Eyes made them welcome, and was kind to them, and\n",
      "took care of them, so that they both, with all their hearts, repented\n",
      "of the evil that they had done in their youth to their sister.\n",

      "_The Old Witch_\n",
      "\n",
      "There was once upon a time, a very old woman, who lived with her flock\n",
      "of geese in a waste place among the mountains, and there had a little\n",
      "house. The waste was surrounded by a large forest, and every morning\n",
      "the Old Woman took her crutch and hobbled into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, however, the dame was quite active, more so than any one would\n",
      "have thought, considering her age, and collected grass for her geese,\n",
      "picked all the wild fruit she could reach, and carried everything home\n",
      "on her back. Any one would have thought that the heavy load would have\n",
      "weighed her to the ground, but she always brought it safely home.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any one met her, she greeted him quite courteously. “Good day, dear\n",
      "Countryman, it is a fine day. Ah! you wonder that I should drag grass\n",
      "about, but every one must take his burthen on his back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, people did not like to meet her if they could help it,\n",
      "and took by preference a roundabout way. And when a father with his\n",
      "boys passed her, he whispered to them, “Beware of the Old Woman. She\n",
      "has claws beneath her gloves. She is a Witch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest. The sun\n",
      "shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept through the leaves,\n",
      "and he was full of joy and gladness. He had as yet met no one, when he\n",
      "suddenly perceived the old Witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass\n",
      "with a sickle. She had already thrust a whole load into her cloth, and\n",
      "near it stood two baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, good little Mother,” said he, “how can you carry all that away?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must carry it, dear Sir,” answered she; “rich folk’s children have\n",
      "no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the saying goes,\n",

      "Besides, my house is not so very far from here. It stands there on the\n",
      "heath behind the hill. How soon you would bound up thither!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man took compassion on the Old Woman. “My father is certainly\n",
      "no peasant,” replied he, “but a rich Count. Nevertheless, that you may\n",
      "see it is not only peasants who can carry things, I will take your\n",
      "bundle.”\n",

      "“If you will try it,” said she, “I shall be very glad. You will\n",

      "Only you must carry the apples and pears as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It now seemed to the young man just a little serious, when he heard\n",
      "of an hour’s walk, but the Old Woman would not let him off, packed the\n",
      "bundle on his back, and hung the two baskets on his arm. “See, it is\n",
      "quite light,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it is not light,” answered the Count, and pulled a rueful\n",
      "face. “Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of\n",
      "cobblestones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead! I can\n",
      "scarcely breathe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a mind to put everything down again, but the Old Woman would\n",
      "not allow it. “Just look,” said she mockingly, “the young gentleman\n",
      "will not carry what I, an old woman, have so often dragged along! You\n",
      "are ready with fine words, but when it comes to being in earnest, you\n",
      "want to take to your heels. Why are you standing loitering there?” she\n",
      "continued. “Step out. No one will take the bundle off again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as he walked on level ground, it was still bearable, but when\n",
      "they came to the hill and had to climb, and the stones rolled down\n",
      "under his feet as if they were alive, it was beyond his strength. The\n",
      "drops of perspiration stood on his forehead, and ran, hot and cold,\n",
      "down his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dame,” said he, “I can go no farther. I want to rest a little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not here,” answered the Old Woman, “when we have arrived at our\n",
      "journey’s end, you can rest. But now you must go forward. Who knows\n",
      "what good it may do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old woman, you are shameless!” said the Count, and tried to throw off\n",
      "the bundle, but he labored in vain. It stuck as fast to his back, as if\n",
      "it grew there. He turned and twisted, but he could not get rid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman laughed at this, and sprang about quite delighted on her\n",
      "crutch. “Don’t get angry, dear Sir,” said she, “you are growing as red\n",
      "in the face as a turkey-cock! Carry your bundle patiently. I will give\n",
      "you a good present when we get home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What could he do? He was obliged to submit to his fate, and crawl\n",
      "along patiently behind the Old Woman. She seemed to grow more and more\n",
      "nimble, and his burden still heavier. All at once, she made a spring,\n",
      "jumped on to the bundle and seated herself on the top of it. And\n",
      "however withered she might be, she was yet heavier than the stoutest\n",
      "country lass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth’s knees trembled, but when he did not go on, the Old Woman\n",
      "hit him about the legs with a switch and with stinging-nettles.\n",
      "Groaning continually, he climbed the mountain, and at length reached\n",
      "the Old Woman’s house, when he was just about to drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the geese perceived the Old Woman, they flapped their wings,\n",
      "stretched out their necks, ran to meet her, cackling all the while.\n",
      "Behind the flock walked, stick in hand, an old wench, strong and big,\n",

      "bad, but, on the contrary, with this kind gentleman, who has carried\n",
      "my burthen for me. Only think, he even took me on his back when I was\n",
      "tired. The way, too, has not seemed long to us. We have been merry, and\n",
      "have been cracking jokes with each other all the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Old Woman slid down, took the bundle off the young man’s\n",
      "back, and the baskets from his arm, looked at him quite kindly, and\n",
      "said, “Now seat yourself on the bench before the door, and rest. You\n",
      "have fairly earned your wages, and they shall not be wanting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said to the goose-girl, “Go into the house, my little\n",

      "In the meantime, the Old Woman stroked and fondled her geese as if they\n",
      "were children, and then went into the house with her daughter. The\n",
      "youth lay down on the bench, under a wild apple-tree. The air was warm\n",
      "and mild. On all sides stretched a green meadow, which was set with\n",
      "cowslips, wild thyme, and a thousand other flowers. Through the midst\n",
      "of it rippled a clear brook on which the sun sparkled, and the white\n",
      "geese went walking backward and forward, or paddled in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is quite delightful here,” said he, “but I am so tired that I\n",
      "cannot keep my eyes open. I will sleep a little. If only a gust of wind\n",
      "does not come and blow my legs off my body, for they are as brittle as\n",
      "tinder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had slept a little while, the Old Woman came and shook him till\n",
      "he awoke. “Sit up,” said she, “you cannot stay here. I have certainly\n",
      "treated you badly, still it has not cost you your life. Of money and\n",
      "land you have no need, here is something else for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon she thrust a little book into his hand, which was cut out of\n",
      "a single emerald. “Take great care of it,” said she, “it will bring you\n",
      "good fortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Count sprang up, and as he felt that he was quite fresh, and had\n",
      "recovered his vigor, he thanked the Old Woman for her present, and set\n",
      "off without even once looking back at the beautiful daughter. When he\n",
      "was already some way off, he still heard in the distance the noisy cry\n",
      "of the geese.\n",
      "\n",
      "For three days, the Count had to wander in the wilderness before he\n",
      "could find his way out. He then reached a large town. As no one knew\n",
      "him, he was led into the royal palace, where the King and Queen were\n",
      "sitting on their throne. The Count fell on one knee, drew the emerald\n",
      "book out of his pocket, and laid it at the Queen’s feet. She bade him\n",
      "rise and hand her the little book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly, however, had she opened it, and looked therein, than she fell\n",
      "as if dead to the ground. The Count was seized by the King’s servants,\n",
      "and was being led to prison, when the Queen opened her eyes, and\n",

      "Every morning I awake in pain and sorrow. I had three daughters, the\n",
      "youngest of whom was so beautiful, that the whole world looked on her\n",
      "as a wonder. She was as white as snow, as rosy as apple-blossoms, and\n",
      "her hair as radiant as sunbeams. When she cried, not tears fell from\n",

      "Then the King spoke, ‘My Daughters, I know not when my last hour may\n",

      "a needle.\n",

      "bolted it. But in the morning, when he unlocked the door, he saw that\n",
      "their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how\n",
      "that had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover\n",
      "where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and\n",
      "be King after his death. But that whosoever came forward and had not\n",
      "discovered it within three days and nights, should forfeit his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before a King’s Son presented himself, and offered to\n",
      "undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was\n",
      "led into a room adjoining the Princesses’ sleeping-chamber. His bed\n",
      "was placed there, and he was to watch where they went and danced. And\n",
      "in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other\n",
      "place, the door of their room was left open.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the eyelids of the Prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for\n",
      "their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his\n",
      "head was struck off without mercy. Many others came after this and\n",
      "undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could\n",
      "serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King\n",
      "lived. There he met an Old Woman, who asked him where he was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hardly know myself,” answered he, and added in jest, “I had half a\n",
      "mind to discover where the Princesses danced their shoes into holes,\n",
      "and thus become King.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not so difficult,” said the Old Woman, “you must not drink the\n",
      "wine which will be brought to you at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, “If you put on that,\n",
      "you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the soldier had received this good advice, he took heart, went to\n",
      "the King, and announced himself as a suitor. He was as well received as\n",
      "the others, and royal garments were put upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conducted that evening, at bedtime, into the outer-chamber, and\n",
      "as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of\n",
      "wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay down, but did not drink the wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Twelve Princesses, in their chamber, laughed, and the eldest said,\n",
      "“He, too, might as well have saved his life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and\n",
      "brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors,\n",
      "sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the youngest said, “I know not how it is. You are very happy, but\n",
      "I feel strange. Some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a goose, who are always frightened,” said the eldest. “Have\n",
      "you forgotten how many King’s Sons have already come here in vain? I\n",
      "had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught. In any\n",
      "case, the clown would not have awakened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were all ready, the eldest then went to her bed and tapped it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It immediately sank into the earth; and one after the other they\n",
      "descended through the opening, the eldest going first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his\n",
      "little cloak, and went down last with the youngest. Half-way down the\n",
      "steps, he just trod a little on her dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was terrified at that, and cried out, “What is that? who is pulling\n",
      "at my dress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be so silly!” said the eldest, “you have caught it on a nail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they\n",
      "were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves\n",
      "of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought,\n",
      "“I must carry a token away with me,” and broke off a twig from one of\n",
      "them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youngest cried out again, “Something is wrong, did you hear the\n",
      "crack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the eldest said, “It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got\n",
      "rid of our Prince so quickly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold,\n",
      "and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds. He broke\n",
      "off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the\n",
      "youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still declared that\n",
      "they were salutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little\n",
      "boats, and in every boat sat a handsome Prince, all of whom were\n",
      "waiting for the Twelve Princesses. Each took one of them with him, but\n",
      "the soldier seated himself by the youngest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her Prince said, “I can’t tell why the boat is so much heavier\n",
      "to-day. I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it\n",
      "across.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What should cause that,” said the youngest, “but the warm weather? I\n",
      "feel very warm too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle,\n",
      "from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums.\n",
      "They rowed thither, entered, and each Prince danced with the maiden he\n",
      "loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen. And when one of them\n",
      "had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty\n",
      "when she carried it to her mouth. The youngest was alarmed at this, but\n",
      "the eldest always made her be silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "They danced there till three o’clock in the morning, when all the shoes\n",
      "were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off. The Princes\n",
      "rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated\n",
      "himself by the eldest. On the shore they took leave of their Princes,\n",
      "and promised to return the following night.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the stairs, the soldier ran on in front and lay down\n",
      "in his bed, and when the Twelve Princesses had come up slowly and\n",
      "wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him,\n",
      "and they said, “So far as he is concerned, we are safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out\n",
      "shoes under the bed, and lay down. Next morning, the soldier was\n",
      "resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and that\n",
      "night again went with them. Then everything was done just as it had\n",
      "been done the first time, and they danced until their shoes were worn\n",
      "to pieces. But the third time, he took a cup away with him as a token.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three\n",
      "twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the Twelve Princesses\n",
      "stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King put the question, “Where have my Twelve Daughters danced\n",
      "their shoes to pieces in the night?” he answered, “In an underground\n",
      "castle with Twelve Princes,” and related how it had come to pass, and\n",
      "brought out the tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had\n",
      "told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that\n",
      "falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have for his wife?\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, “I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom\n",
      "was promised him after the King’s death. But the Princes were bewitched\n",
      "for as many days more as they had danced nights with the Twelve.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was once upon a time, a miller who lived with his wife in great\n",
      "contentment. They had money and land, and their prosperity increased\n",
      "year by year more and more. But ill-luck comes like a thief in the\n",
      "night, as their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by\n",
      "year.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived his\n",
      "own. He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day’s\n",
      "work, found no rest, but full of care, tossed about in his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air,\n",
      "thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter. As he\n",
      "was stepping over the mill-dam, the first sunbeam was just breaking\n",
      "forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond. He turned round and\n",
      "perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water. Her long\n",
      "hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell\n",
      "down on both sides, and covered her white body.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw that she was the Nix of the Mill-pond, and in his fright did not\n",
      "know whether he should run away or stay where he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Nix made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and\n",
      "asked him why he was so sad? The miller was at first struck dumb, but\n",
      "when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he\n",
      "had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor\n",
      "that he did not know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be easy,” answered the Nix, “I will make you richer and happier than\n",
      "you have ever been before, only you must promise to give me the young\n",
      "thing which has just been born in your house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What else can that be,” thought the miller, “but a young puppy or\n",
      "kitten?” and he promised her what she desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nix descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his\n",
      "mill, consoled and in good spirits. He had not yet reached it, when the\n",
      "maid-servant came out of the house, and cried to him to rejoice, for\n",
      "his wife had a little boy. The miller stood as if struck by lightning.\n",
      "He saw very well that the cunning Nix had been aware of it, and had\n",
      "cheated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanging his head, he went up to his wife’s bedside and when she said,\n",
      "“Why do you not rejoice over the fine boy?” he told her what had\n",
      "befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the Nix. “Of\n",
      "what use to me are riches and prosperity?” he added, “if I am to lose\n",
      "my child; but what can I do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the relations, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not\n",
      "know what to say. In the meantime prosperity again returned to the\n",
      "miller’s house. All that he undertook succeeded; it was as if presses\n",
      "and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money\n",
      "multiplied nightly in the cupboards. It was not long before his wealth\n",
      "was greater than it had ever been before. But he could not rejoice over\n",
      "it untroubled, the bargain which he had made with the Nix tormented his\n",
      "soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind\n",
      "him of his debt. He never let the boy himself go near the water.\n",
      "“Beware,” he said to him, “if you do but touch the water, a hand will\n",
      "rise, seize you, and draw you down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But as year after year went by, and the Nix did not show herself again,\n",
      "the miller began to feel at ease. The boy grew up to be a youth and\n",
      "was apprenticed to a huntsman. When he had learnt everything, and had\n",
      "become an excellent huntsman, the lord of the village took him into his\n",
      "service. In the village lived a beautiful and true-hearted maiden, who\n",
      "pleased the huntsman. When his master perceived that, he gave him a\n",
      "little house, the two were married, lived peacefully and happily, and\n",
      "loved each other with all their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the huntsman was chasing a roe. And when the animal turned\n",
      "aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued it and at last\n",
      "shot it. He did not notice that he was now in the neighborhood of the\n",
      "dangerous mill-pond, and went, after he had disembowelled the stag, to\n",
      "the water, in order to wash his blood-stained hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely, however, had he dipped them in than the Nix ascended,\n",
      "smilingly wound her dripping arms around him, and drew him quickly down\n",
      "under the waves, which closed over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was evening, and the huntsman did not return home, his wife\n",
      "grew alarmed. She went out to seek him, and as he had often told her\n",
      "that he had to be on his guard against the snares of the Nix, and\n",
      "dared not venture into the neighborhood of the mill-pond, she already\n",
      "suspected what had happened. She hastened to the water, and when she\n",
      "found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore, she could no longer have\n",
      "any doubt of the misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamenting her sorrow, and wringing her hands, she called on her beloved\n",
      "by name, but in vain. She hurried across to the other side of the\n",
      "pond, and called him anew. She reviled the Nix with harsh words, but\n",
      "no answer followed. The surface of the water remained calm, only the\n",
      "crescent moon stared steadily back at her. The poor woman did not leave\n",
      "the pond. With hasty steps, she paced round and round it, without\n",
      "resting a moment, sometimes in silence, sometimes uttering a loud cry,\n",
      "sometimes softly sobbing. At last her strength came to an end, she sank\n",
      "down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a dream took possession of her. She was anxiously climbing\n",
      "upward between great masses of rock. Thorns and briars caught her feet,\n",
      "the rain beat in her face, and the wind tossed her long hair about.\n",
      "When she had reached the summit, quite a different sight presented\n",
      "itself to her. The sky was blue, the air soft, the ground sloped gently\n",
      "downward, and on a green meadow, gay with flowers of every color, stood\n",
      "a pretty cottage. She went up to it and opened the door. There sat an\n",
      "Old Woman with white hair, who beckoned to her kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment, the poor woman awoke, day had already dawned,\n",
      "and she at once resolved to act in accordance with her dream. She\n",
      "laboriously climbed the mountain. Everything was exactly as she\n",
      "had seen it in the night. The Old Woman received her kindly, and\n",
      "pointed out a chair on which she might sit. “You must have met with a\n",
      "misfortune,” she said, “since you have sought out my lonely cottage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With tears, the woman related what had befallen her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be comforted,” said the Old Woman, “I will help you. Here is a Golden\n",
      "Comb for you. Tarry till the full moon has risen, then go to the\n",
      "mill-pond, seat yourself on the shore, and comb your long black hair\n",
      "with this comb. When you have done, lay it down on the bank, and you\n",
      "will see what will happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman returned home, but the time till the full moon came, passed\n",
      "slowly. At last the shining disc appeared in the heavens, then she went\n",
      "out to the mill-pond, sat down and combed her long black hair with the\n",
      "Golden Comb. When she had finished, she laid it down at the water’s\n",
      "edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before there was a movement in the depths, a wave rose,\n",
      "rolled to the shore, and bore the comb away with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the bottom,\n",
      "the surface of the water parted, and the head of the huntsman arose.\n",
      "He did not speak, but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances. At\n",
      "the same instant, a second wave came rushing up, and covered the man’s\n",
      "head. All had vanished, the mill-pond lay peaceful as before, and\n",
      "nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Full of sorrow, the woman went back, but again the dream showed\n",
      "her the cottage of the Old Woman. Next morning, she again set out and\n",
      "complained of her woes to the Wise Woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Woman gave her a Golden Flute, and said, “Tarry till the full\n",
      "moon comes again, then take this flute. Play a beautiful air on it, and\n",
      "when you have finished, lay it on the sand. Then you will see what will\n",
      "happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wife did as the old woman told her. No sooner was the flute lying\n",
      "on the sand, than there was a stirring in the depths, and a wave rushed\n",
      "up and bore the flute away with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately afterward the water parted, and not only the head of\n",
      "the man, but half of his body also arose. He stretched out his arms\n",
      "longingly toward her. But a second wave came up, covered him, and drew\n",
      "him down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, what does it profit me?” said the unhappy woman, “that I should\n",
      "see my beloved, only to lose him again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despair filled her heart anew, but the dream led her a third time\n",
      "to the house of the Old Woman. She sat out, and the Wise Woman gave\n",
      "her a Golden Spinning-Wheel, consoled her and said, “All is not yet\n",
      "fulfilled, tarry until the time of the full moon. Then take the\n",
      "spinning-wheel, seat yourself on the shore, and spin the spool full.\n",
      "When you have done that, place the spinning-wheel near the water, and\n",
      "you will see what will happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman obeyed all she said exactly. As soon as the full moon showed\n",
      "itself, she carried the Golden Spinning-Wheel to the shore, and spun\n",
      "industriously until the flax came to an end, and the spool was quite\n",
      "filled with the threads. No sooner was the wheel standing on the shore\n",
      "than there was a more violent movement than before in the depths of\n",
      "the pond, and a mighty wave rushed up, and bore the wheel away with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately the head and the whole body of the man rose into the air,\n",
      "in a water-spout. He quickly sprang to the shore, caught his wife by\n",
      "the hand and fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they had scarcely gone a very little distance, when the whole pond\n",
      "rose with a frightful roar, and streamed out over the open country. The\n",
      "fugitives already saw death before their eyes, when the woman in her\n",
      "terror implored the help of the Old Woman, and in an instant they were\n",
      "transformed, she into a Toad, he into a Frog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flood which had overtaken them could not destroy them, but it tore\n",
      "them apart and carried them far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again, they\n",
      "regained their human form, but neither knew where the other was. They\n",
      "found themselves among strange people, who did not know their native\n",
      "land. High mountains and deep valleys lay between them. In order to\n",
      "keep themselves alive, they were both obliged to tend sheep.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many long years, they drove their flocks through field and forest\n",
      "and were full of sorrow and longing. When spring had once more broken\n",
      "forth on the earth, one day they both went out with their flocks, and\n",
      "as chance would have it, they drew near each other. They met in a\n",
      "valley, but did not recognize each other. Yet they rejoiced that they\n",
      "were no longer so lonely. Henceforth they every day drove their flocks\n",
      "to the same place. They did not speak much, but they felt comforted.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening when the full moon was shining in the sky, and the sheep\n",
      "were already at rest, the shepherd pulled the flute out of his pocket,\n",
      "and played on it a beautiful but sorrowful air. When he had finished,\n",
      "he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why are you weeping?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas,” answered she, “thus shone the full moon when I played this air\n",
      "on the flute for the last time, and the head of my beloved rose out of\n",
      "the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her, and it seemed as if a veil fell from his eyes, and\n",
      "he recognized his dear wife. And when she looked at him, and the moon\n",
      "shone in his face she knew him also. They embraced and kissed each\n",

      "A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little\n",
      "hut on the edge of a lonely wood. One morning as he was about to go to\n",
      "his work, he said to his wife, “Let my dinner be brought into the wood\n",
      "to me by my eldest daughter, or I shall never get my work done. And in\n",
      "order that she may not miss her way,” he added, “I will take a bag of\n",
      "millet with me and strew the seeds on the path.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When, therefore, the sun was just above the centre of the wood, the\n",
      "girl set out on her way with a bowl of soup. But the field-sparrows,\n",
      "and wood-sparrows, larks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked\n",
      "up the millet long before, and the girl could not find the track. Then\n",
      "trusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and night\n",
      "began to fall. The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and\n",
      "she began to be afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the\n",
      "trees. “There ought to be some people living there, who can take me in\n",
      "for the night,” thought she, and went up to the light. It was not long\n",
      "before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knocked, and a rough voice from the inside cried, “Come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of the\n",
      "room. “Just come in,” cried the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when she opened the door, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the\n",
      "table, supporting his face with both hands, and his white beard fell\n",
      "down over the table almost as far as the ground. By the stove lay three\n",
      "animals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl told her story to the Old Man, and begged for shelter for the\n",
      "night. The man said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Pretty little Hen,\n",
      "      Pretty little Cock,\n",
      "      And pretty brindled Cow,\n",
      "      What say ye all now?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Duks,_” answered the animals, and that must have meant, “We are\n",
      "willing,” for the Old Man said, “Here you shall have shelter and food.\n",
      "Go to the fire, and cook us our supper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything and cooked a good\n",
      "supper, but had no thought of the animals. She carried the full dishes\n",
      "to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man, ate and satisfied\n",
      "her hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had had enough, she said, “But now I am tired. Where is there\n",
      "a bed in which I can lie down, and sleep?” The animals replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Thou hast eaten with him,\n",
      "      Thou hast drunk with him,\n",
      "      Thou hast had no thought for us,\n",
      "      So find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the Old Man, “Just go up-stairs, and you will find a room\n",
      "with two beds. Shake them up, and put white linen on them, and then I,\n",
      "too, will come and lie down to sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl went up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets\n",
      "on, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for the Old\n",
      "Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time, however, the gray-haired man came, took his candle,\n",
      "looked at the girl and shook his head. When he saw that she had fallen\n",
      "into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her down into the\n",
      "cellar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late at night, the woodcutter came home, and reproached his wife for\n",
      "leaving him to hunger all day. “It is not my fault,” she replied, “the\n",
      "girl went out with your dinner, and must have lost herself, but she is\n",
      "sure to come back to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The woodcutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the wood, and\n",
      "requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day.\n",
      "“I will take a bag with lentils,” said he; “the seeds are larger than\n",
      "millet. The girl will see them better, and can’t lose her way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took out the food, but the lentils\n",
      "had disappeared. The birds of the wood had picked them up as they had\n",
      "done the day before, and had left none.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl wandered about in the wood until night, and then she too\n",
      "reached the house of the Old Man, was told to go in, and begged for\n",
      "food and a bed. The man with the white beard again asked the animals:\n",
      "\n",
      "     “_Pretty little Hen,_\n",
      "      _Pretty little Cock,_\n",
      "      _And pretty brindled Cow,_\n",
      "      _What say ye all now?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "The animals again replied “_Duks_.” And everything happened just as it\n",
      "had happened the day before. The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank\n",
      "with the Old Man, and did not concern herself about the animals, and\n",
      "when she inquired about her bed, they answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "     “_Thou hast eaten with him,_\n",
      "      _Thou hast drunk with him,_\n",
      "      _Thou hast had, no thought for us,_\n",
      "      _So find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night._”\n",
      "\n",
      "When she was asleep the Old Man came, looked at her, shook his head,\n",
      "and let her down into the cellar.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third morning, the woodcutter said to his wife, “Send our\n",
      "youngest child out with my dinner to-day, she has always been good and\n",
      "obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not run about after\n",
      "every wild bumblebee, as her sisters did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother did not want to do it, and said, “Am I to lose my dearest\n",
      "child, as well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have no fear,” he replied, “the girl will not go astray; she is too\n",
      "prudent and sensible. Besides, I will take some peas with me, and strew\n",
      "them about. They are still larger than lentils, and will show her the\n",
      "way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the girl went out with her basket on her arm, the wood-pigeons\n",
      "had already got all the peas in their crops, and she did not know which\n",
      "way to turn. She was full of sorrow and never ceased to think how\n",
      "hungry her father would be, and how her good mother would grieve, if\n",
      "she did not return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, when it grew dark, she saw the light and came to the house\n",
      "in the wood. She begged quite prettily to be allowed to spend the night\n",
      "there. And the man with the white beard once more asked his animals:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Pretty little Hen,\n",
      "      Pretty little Cock,\n",
      "      And pretty brindled Cow,\n",
      "      What say ye all now?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Duks_,” said they. Then the girl went to the stove where the animals\n",
      "were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked their smooth\n",
      "feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled cow between her horns.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when, in obedience to the Old Man’s orders, she had made ready some\n",
      "good soup, and the bowl was placed upon the table, she said, “Am I to\n",
      "eat as much as I want, and the good animals to have nothing? Outside is\n",
      "food in plenty, I will look after them first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she went and brought some barley and strewed it for the cock and\n",
      "hen, and a whole armful of sweet-smelling hay for the cow. “I hope you\n",
      "will like it, dear Animals,” said she, “and you shall have a refreshing\n",
      "draught in case you are thirsty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she fetched in a bucketful of water, and the cock and hen jumped\n",
      "on to the edge of it and dipped their beaks in. Then held up their\n",
      "heads as the birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also took a\n",
      "hearty draught.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by the\n",
      "Old Man, and ate what he had left. It was not long before the cock and\n",
      "the hen began to thrust their heads beneath their wings, and the eyes\n",
      "of the cow likewise began to blink. Then said the girl, “Ought we not\n",
      "to go to bed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Pretty little Hen,\n",
      "      Pretty little Cock,\n",
      "      And pretty brindled Cow,\n",
      "      What say ye all now?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "The animals answered “_Duks_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Thou hast eaten with us,\n",
      "      Thou hast drunk with us,\n",
      "      Thou hast had kind thought for all of us,\n",
      "      We wish thee good-night._”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the girl went up-stairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid clean\n",
      "sheets on them. And when she had done it the Old Man came and lay down\n",
      "on one of the beds, and his white beard reached down to his feet. The\n",
      "girl lay down on the other, said her prayers, and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "She slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise in the\n",
      "house that she awoke. There was a sound of cracking and splitting in\n",
      "every corner. The doors sprang open, and beat against the walls. The\n",
      "beams groaned as if they were being torn out of their joints. It seemed\n",
      "as if the staircase were falling down. And at length there was a crash\n",
      "as if the entire roof had fallen in.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl was not hurt, she\n",
      "stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell asleep again. But when she\n",
      "woke up in the morning with the brilliancy of the sunshine, what did\n",
      "her eyes behold?\n",
      "\n",
      "She was lying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with\n",
      "royal splendor. On the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of\n",
      "green silk. The bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet, and on\n",
      "a chair close by, was a pair of shoes embroidered with pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl believed that she was in a dream, but three richly clad\n",
      "attendants came in, and asked what orders she would like to give?\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you will go,” she replied, “I will get up at once and make ready\n",
      "some soup for the Old Man, and then I will feed the pretty little hen,\n",
      "and the cock, and the beautiful brindled cow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought the Old Man was up already, and looked round at his bed.\n",
      "He, however, was not lying in it, but a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was young\n",
      "and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, “I am a King’s Son,\n",
      "and was enchanted by a wicked Witch, and made to live in this wood, as\n",
      "an old gray-haired man. No one was allowed to be with me but my three\n",
      "attendants in the form of a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow. The spell\n",
      "was not to be broken until a girl came to us, whose heart was so good\n",
      "that she showed herself full of love, not only toward mankind, but\n",
      "toward animals--and that you have done, and by you, at midnight, we\n",
      "were set free, and the old house in the wood was changed back again\n",
      "into my royal palace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they had arisen, the King’s Son ordered the three attendants\n",
      "to set out and fetch the father and mother of the girl to the marriage\n",
      "feast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But where are my two sisters?” inquired the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have locked them in the cellar, and to-morrow they shall be led into\n",
      "the wood, and shall live as servants to a charcoal-burner, until they\n",
      "have grown kinder, and do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter\n",
      "of a mighty King. She was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful.\n",
      "As her father wished to give her to another, the Prince was rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would\n",
      "not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and\n",
      "will take no other for my husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be\n",
      "built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When\n",
      "it was finished, he said, “Therein shall you be imprisoned for seven\n",
      "years, and then I will come and see if your perverse spirit is broken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower; and\n",
      "then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and\n",
      "thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the\n",
      "darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s Son often\n",
      "went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound\n",
      "from without pierced through the thick walls. What else could they do\n",
      "but lament and complain?\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the time passed, and by the small amount of food and drink\n",
      "left they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought\n",
      "the moment of their deliverance was come. But no stroke of the hammer\n",
      "was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen\n",
      "that her father had forgotten her. As they had food for only a short\n",
      "time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said,\n",
      "“We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a\n",
      "stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With\n",
      "great labor they succeeded in getting out one stone, then a second, and\n",
      "third. And when three days were over, the first ray of light fell on\n",
      "their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could\n",
      "look out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how\n",
      "melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay\n",
      "in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen,\n",
      "destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human\n",
      "being was visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through,\n",
      "the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But\n",
      "where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven\n",
      "away the King, and slain all the inhabitants. They wandered forth to\n",
      "seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human\n",
      "being to give them a mouthful of bread. Their need was so great that\n",
      "they were forced to appease their hunger with nettle-plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried\n",
      "to get work everywhere. But wherever they knocked they were turned\n",
      "away, and no one would have pity on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace.\n",
      "There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that\n",
      "they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s Son in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man\n",
      "who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another\n",
      "Bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. The\n",
      "wedding was fixed, and the girl had already arrived. Because of her\n",
      "great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no\n",
      "one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the\n",
      "kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day came for the Bride and the Bridegroom to go to church,\n",
      "she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself\n",
      "in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then\n",
      "said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen you. I\n",
      "have sprained my foot, and cannot walk through the streets. You shall\n",
      "put on my wedding-clothes and take my place. A greater honor than that\n",
      "you cannot have!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honor which\n",
      "is not suitable for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain, too, that the Bride offered her gold. At last she\n",
      "said angrily, “If you do not obey me, it shall cost you your life. I\n",
      "have but to speak the word, and your head will lie at your feet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she was forced to obey, and put on the Bride’s magnificent clothes\n",
      "and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was\n",
      "amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the\n",
      "Bride whom I have chosen for you, and whom you must lead to church.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid\n",
      "Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long\n",
      "been shut up in the tower or dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a\n",
      "nettle-plant, and she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Nettle-plant, Nettle-plant,\n",
      "      Nettle-plant so small!\n",
      "      What are you doing here,\n",
      "      Alone by the wall?\n",
      "      I have the time known,\n",
      "      When unroasted, unboiled,\n",
      "      I ate thee alone!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you saying?” asked the King’s Son.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they\n",
      "came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Foot-bridge, break not,\n",
      "      I am not the true Bride._”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you saying there?” asked the King’s Son.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came to the church-door, she said once more:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “_Church-door, break not,\n",
      "      I am not the true Bride._”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened\n",
      "the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined\n",
      "their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her\n",
      "home but she did not speak a single word the whole way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the Bride’s\n",
      "chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed\n",
      "herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck,\n",
      "which she had received from the Bridegroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the night came, and the Bride was to be led into the apartment of\n",
      "the King’s Son, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not\n",
      "observe the deception.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What did you say\n",
      "to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you did not do it, then you are not the true Bride,” said he.\n",
      "\n",

      "drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had\n",
      "belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She\n",
      "had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had\n",
      "become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most\n",
      "of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by\n",
      "careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of\n",
      "to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\n",
      "thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one\n",
      "of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the\n",
      "nursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have\n",
      "no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She\n",
      "believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf,\n",
      "and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs,\n",
      "and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the\n",
      "children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well\n",
      "behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John’s\n",
      "footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried\n",
      "an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\n",
      "basement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait. They sat on\n",
      "forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.\n",
      "They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to\n",
      "themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to\n",
      "the nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first\n",
      "whipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue\n",
      "braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.\n",
      "Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the\n",
      "neighbours talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his position in the city to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that\n",

      "Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children\n",
      "to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the\n",
      "only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget\n",
      "she looked in her long skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when\n",
      "engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!\n",
      "And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that\n",
      "all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at\n",
      "her you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family\n",
      "until the coming of Peter Pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her\n",
      "children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after\n",
      "her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things\n",
      "straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many\n",
      "articles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake\n",
      "(but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and\n",
      "you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like\n",
      "tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering\n",
      "humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had\n",
      "picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,\n",
      "pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and\n",
      "hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the\n",
      "naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been\n",

      "become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a\n",
      "child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the\n",
      "time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a\n",
      "card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is\n",
      "always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here\n",
      "and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and\n",
      "savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves\n",
      "through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a\n",
      "hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked\n",
      "nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first\n",
      "day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,\n",
      "hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting\n",
      "into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth\n",
      "yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they\n",

      "it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a\n",
      "wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no\n",
      "friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by\n",
      "its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,\n",
      "and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have\n",
      "each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play\n",
      "are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there; we can\n",
      "still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most\n",
      "compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances\n",
      "between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at\n",
      "it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least\n",

      "\n",
      "Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling\n",
      "found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most\n",

      "here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is\n",
      "just my size.” She meant that he was her size in both mind and body;\n",
      "she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark my\n",
      "words,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their\n",
      "heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it\n",
      "will blow over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.\n",
      "Darling quite a shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.\n",
      "For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event\n",
      "happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead\n",
      "father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy\n",
      "one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had\n",
      "been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when\n",
      "the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when\n",
      "Wendy said with a tolerant smile:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do believe it is that Peter again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing.\n",
      "She was a tidy child.\n",
      "\n",
      "She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter\n",
      "sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her\n",
      "bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so\n",
      "she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house\n",
      "without knocking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, it is three floors up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural\n",
      "to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined\n",
      "them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they\n",
      "did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the\n",
      "floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She\n",
      "rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a\n",
      "tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty\n",
      "feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the\n",
      "night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be\n",
      "said to have begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It\n",
      "happened to be Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and\n",
      "sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away\n",
      "into the land of sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and\n",
      "sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into\n",
      "shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three\n",
      "night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then\n",
      "her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of\n",
      "them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the\n",
      "fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come\n",
      "too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not\n",
      "alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many\n",
      "women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of\n",
      "some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures\n",
      "the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through\n",
      "the gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was\n",
      "dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the\n",
      "floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist,\n",
      "which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must\n",
      "have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.\n",
      "\n",
      "She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at\n",
      "once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we\n",
      "should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a\n",
      "lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of\n",
      "trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his\n",
      "first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little\n",
      "pearls at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,\n",
      "and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang\n",
      "at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling\n",
      "screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,\n",
      "and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it\n",
      "was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see\n",
      "nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her\n",
      "mouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window\n",
      "Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had\n",
      "not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was\n",
      "quite the ordinary kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.\n",
      "She hung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it;\n",
      "let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the\n",
      "children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the\n",
      "window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the\n",
      "house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up\n",
      "winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his\n",
      "head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;\n",
      "besides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a\n",
      "dog for a nurse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a\n",
      "drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah\n",
      "me!\n",
      "\n",
      "The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten\n",
      "Friday. Of course it was a Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say\n",
      "afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of\n",
      "her, holding her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all. I,\n",
      "George Darling, did it. _Mea culpa, mea culpa_.” He had had a classical\n",
      "education.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every\n",
      "detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other\n",
      "side like the faces on a bad coinage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs.\n",
      "Darling said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr.\n",
      "Darling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet\n",
      "eyes said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My liking for parties, George.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the\n",
      "thought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a\n",
      "nurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to\n",
      "Nana’s eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of\n",
      "it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\n",
      "right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every\n",
      "smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,\n",
      "so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the\n",
      "water for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that\n",
      "he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t. Nana, it isn’t\n",
      "six o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana. I\n",
      "tell you I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had\n",
      "dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,\n",
      "with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s\n",
      "bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to\n",
      "lend her bracelet to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had found her two older children playing at being herself and\n",
      "father on the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,” in\n",
      "just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real\n",
      "occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have\n",
      "done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the\n",
      "birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,\n",
      "but John said brutally that they did not want any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the\n",
      "lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be\n",
      "Michael’s last night in the nursery.\n",
      "\n",
      "They go on with their recollections.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr. Darling\n",
      "would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for\n",
      "the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It\n",
      "is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew\n",
      "about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the\n",
      "thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when\n",
      "it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride\n",
      "and used a made-up tie.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the\n",
      "crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not tie.” He\n",
      "became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!\n",
      "Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my\n",
      "neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on\n",
      "sternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my\n",
      "neck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to\n",
      "dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to\n",
      "the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into\n",
      "the streets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and\n",
      "indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice\n",
      "cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to\n",
      "see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to\n",
      "do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he\n",
      "thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment\n",
      "was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you\n",
      "get to know me, mother?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.\n",
      "Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They\n",
      "were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had\n",
      "with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears\n",
      "coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again\n",
      "about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“George, Nana is a treasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon\n",
      "the children as puppies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.” It was an\n",
      "opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he\n",
      "pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the\n",
      "shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does\n",
      "look a scoundrel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when\n",
      "Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry the bottle\n",
      "in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather\n",
      "foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking\n",
      "that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when\n",
      "Michael dodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be\n",
      "a man, Michael.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to\n",
      "get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of\n",
      "firmness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her. “Michael, when I was\n",
      "your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, ‘Thank you, kind\n",
      "parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her\n",
      "night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That\n",
      "medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it\n",
      "now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the\n",
      "top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that\n",
      "the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of\n",
      "service. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her.\n",
      "Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff. It’s that nasty,\n",
      "sticky, sweet kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed\n",
      "Wendy with the medicine in a glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a\n",
      "vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael\n",
      "first,” he said doggedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, father,” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that there is more\n",
      "in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart was nearly\n",
      "bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my\n",
      "last breath; it isn’t fair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father’s a cowardly custard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So are you a cowardly custard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not frightened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Neither am I frightened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, take it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, you take it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready, Michael?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,\n",
      "but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded. “Stop that row,\n",
      "Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if\n",
      "they did not admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly,\n",
      "as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a\n",
      "splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will\n",
      "drink it, thinking it is milk!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s\n",
      "sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the\n",
      "medicine into Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they did\n",
      "not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into\n",
      "your bowl, Nana.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then\n",
      "she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the\n",
      "great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into\n",
      "her kennel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give\n",
      "in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she\n",
      "said, “it’s your medicine!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\n",
      "Wendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to\n",
      "the bone trying to be funny in this house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted. “Coddle her!\n",
      "Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I\n",
      "be coddled—why, why, why!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants will\n",
      "hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the\n",
      "servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole world. But I\n",
      "refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her\n",
      "back. He felt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;\n",
      "“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\n",
      "this instant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you\n",
      "about that boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in\n",
      "that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he\n",
      "lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly,\n",
      "dragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did\n",
      "it. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for\n",
      "admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched\n",
      "father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted\n",
      "silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and\n",
      "John whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but\n",
      "Wendy was wiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was\n",
      "about to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Danger!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure, Wendy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.\n",
      "She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were\n",
      "crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place\n",
      "there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller\n",
      "ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made\n",
      "her cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he\n",
      "asked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves\n",
      "behind her to guard her children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little\n",
      "Michael flung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of\n",
      "you.” They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall\n",
      "of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly\n",
      "not to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the\n",
      "street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but\n",
      "they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on\n",
      "for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long\n",
      "ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become\n",
      "glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the\n",
      "little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who\n",
      "had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow\n",
      "them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side\n",
      "to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon\n",
      "as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion\n",
      "in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way\n",
      "screamed out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Peter!”\n",

      "\n",
      "For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights\n",
      "by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were\n",
      "awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they\n",
      "could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave\n",
      "such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close\n",
      "their mouths all the three went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than\n",
      "the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had\n",
      "been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow,\n",
      "rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not\n",
      "really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but\n",
      "when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer\n",
      "than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell\n",
      "exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through\n",
      "which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly\n",
      "inclined to _embonpoint_.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by the\n",
      "breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried\n",
      "Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the\n",
      "fairy dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children\n",
      "were asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug for the moment,\n",
      "and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put\n",
      "my shadow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy\n",
      "language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to\n",
      "hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of\n",
      "drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to\n",
      "the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a\n",
      "moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that\n",
      "he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that\n",
      "he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops\n",
      "of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it\n",
      "on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed\n",
      "through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see\n",
      "a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly\n",
      "interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner\n",
      "at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was\n",
      "much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s your name?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction. “What\n",
      "is your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter Pan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a\n",
      "comparatively short name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a\n",
      "shortish name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked where he lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on till morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a funny address!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a\n",
      "funny address.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it isn’t,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, “is that\n",
      "what they put on the letters?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wished she had not mentioned letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But your mother gets letters?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had\n",
      "not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated\n",
      "persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a\n",
      "tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bed and\n",
      "ran to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly. “I was\n",
      "crying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn’t\n",
      "crying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has come off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she\n",
      "was frightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she could\n",
      "not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on\n",
      "with soap. How exactly like a boy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” she\n",
      "said, just a little patronisingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s sewn?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re dreadfully ignorant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’m not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, my\n",
      "little man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out\n",
      "her housewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he\n",
      "had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry,\n",
      "and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little\n",
      "creased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,\n",
      "boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about\n",
      "in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his\n",
      "bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How\n",
      "clever I am!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one\n",
      "of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,\n",
      "there never was a cockier boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit,” she exclaimed,\n",
      "with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little!” she replied with hauteur; “if I am no use I can at least\n",
      "withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and\n",
      "covered her face with the blankets.\n",
      "\n",
      "To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this\n",
      "failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his\n",
      "foot. “Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t help crowing, Wendy,\n",
      "when I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would not look up, though she\n",
      "was listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman\n",
      "has ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than\n",
      "twenty boys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many\n",
      "inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you really think so, Peter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared, “and I’ll get up\n",
      "again,” and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said she\n",
      "would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she\n",
      "meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and not to\n",
      "hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and she replied with a\n",
      "slight primness, “If you please.” She made herself rather cheap by\n",
      "inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button\n",
      "into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been\n",
      "before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain\n",
      "around her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it\n",
      "was afterwards to save her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask\n",
      "each other’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct\n",
      "thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question\n",
      "to ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when\n",
      "what you want to be asked is Kings of England.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quite young.” He really\n",
      "knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a\n",
      "venture, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the\n",
      "charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he\n",
      "could sit nearer her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a low\n",
      "voice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He was\n",
      "extraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be a man,” he said\n",
      "with passion. “I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So I\n",
      "ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the\n",
      "fairies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it\n",
      "was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.\n",
      "Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as\n",
      "quite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,\n",
      "for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,\n",
      "and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding. Still, he liked them\n",
      "on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its\n",
      "laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,\n",
      "and that was the beginning of fairies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be one fairy for\n",
      "every boy and girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ought to be? Isn’t there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believe in\n",
      "fairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe in fairies,’\n",
      "there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it\n",
      "struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think\n",
      "where she has gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name.\n",
      "Wendy’s heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean to tell me that\n",
      "there is a fairy in this room!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “You don’t hear\n",
      "her, do you?” and they both listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle of bells.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hear her too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.\n",
      "No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of\n",
      "gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her up in the\n",
      "drawer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery\n",
      "screaming with fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.\n",
      "“Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the\n",
      "drawer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if she would\n",
      "only stand still and let me see her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendy saw\n",
      "the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O the lovely!”\n",
      "she cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted with passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes you were her\n",
      "fairy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tinker Bell answered insolently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does she say, Peter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a great\n",
      "ugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,\n",
      "because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” and disappeared\n",
      "into the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peter explained\n",
      "apologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots\n",
      "and kettles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him\n",
      "with more questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes I do still.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But where do you live mostly now?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "prams.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it is perfectly\n",
      "lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one\n",
      "kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she\n",
      "told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,\n",
      "John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him\n",
      "to remain there. “And I know you meant to be kind,” she said,\n",
      "relenting, “so you may give me a kiss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thought\n",
      "you would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to\n",
      "return her the thimble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, I mean a\n",

      "\n",
      "“What’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s like this.” She kissed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you a thimble?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,\n",
      "Wendy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, Tink?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understand why,\n",
      "but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he\n",
      "admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to\n",
      "listen to stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any\n",
      "stories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eaves of houses?\n",
      "It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you\n",
      "such a lovely story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which story was it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glass\n",
      "slipper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and he found her,\n",
      "and they lived happily ever after.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been\n",
      "sitting, and hurried to the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To tell the other boys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots of stories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was\n",
      "she who first tempted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought\n",
      "to have alarmed her, but did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and then Peter\n",

      "\n",
      "“Let me go!” she ordered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, I\n",
      "can’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll teach you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, how lovely to fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then away we go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be\n",
      "flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mermaids! With tails?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such long tails.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how we should all\n",
      "respect you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were\n",
      "trying to remain on the nursery floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had no pity for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo,” and her arms went out to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us\n",
      "has any pockets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!” she cried.\n",
      "“Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael\n",
      "and shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan has come and he is to\n",
      "teach us to fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course he was\n",
      "on the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six\n",
      "blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces\n",
      "assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the\n",
      "grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right.\n",
      "No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking\n",
      "distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they\n",
      "had heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command for the\n",
      "only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,\n",
      "holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you\n",
      "would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing\n",
      "angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from\n",
      "behind the window curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in\n",
      "the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her\n",
      "cheek, by Nana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting\n",
      "a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in\n",
      "custody of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was in\n",
      "disgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of the\n",
      "little angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they\n",
      "were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried\n",
      "to drag herself out of Liza’s clutches.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly, pulling\n",
      "her out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight\n",
      "for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,\n",
      "won’t master whip you, just.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to\n",
      "bark? Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just\n",
      "what she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long\n",
      "as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings,\n",
      "and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and\n",
      "strained at the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she\n",
      "had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven,\n",
      "her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling\n",
      "knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,\n",
      "and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing\n",
      "behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now return to the nursery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. “I\n",
      "say, Peter, can you really fly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking\n",
      "the mantelpiece on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How topping!” said John and Michael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How sweet!” cried Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting his manners\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and\n",
      "then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a\n",
      "practical boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained, “and they\n",
      "lift you up in the air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t you do it very slowly\n",
      "once?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now, Wendy!” cried\n",
      "John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,\n",
      "though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not\n",
      "know A from Z.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless\n",
      "the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have\n",
      "mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each\n",
      "of them, with the most superb results.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and let go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did\n",
      "not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne\n",
      "across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.\n",
      "\n",
      "John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, lovely!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, ripping!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a\n",
      "little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is\n",
      "almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,\n",
      "but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a\n",
      "billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mermaids!” said Peter again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And there are pirates.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana\n",
      "out of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the\n",
      "nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze\n",
      "with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in\n",
      "shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling\n",
      "round and round, not on the floor but in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not three figures, four!\n",
      "\n",
      "In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed\n",
      "upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to\n",
      "make her heart go softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them,\n",
      "and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.\n",
      "On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it\n",
      "will all come right in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the\n",
      "little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window\n",
      "open, and that smallest star of all called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cave, Peter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. “Come,” he cried\n",
      "imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John\n",
      "and Michael and Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The\n",
      "birds were flown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even\n",
      "birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not\n",
      "have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said\n",
      "anything that came into his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the\n",
      "delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires\n",
      "or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought\n",
      "themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before\n",
      "this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was\n",
      "their second sea and their third night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold\n",
      "and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they\n",
      "merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding\n",
      "them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable\n",
      "for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and\n",
      "snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for\n",
      "miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy\n",
      "noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this\n",
      "was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that\n",
      "there are other ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that\n",
      "was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful\n",
      "thing was that Peter thought this funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly\n",
      "dropped like a stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea\n",
      "far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch\n",
      "Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way\n",
      "he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it\n",
      "was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human\n",
      "life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one\n",
      "moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the\n",
      "possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back\n",
      "and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light\n",
      "that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were\n",
      "playing “Follow my Leader.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and\n",
      "touch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run\n",
      "your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this\n",
      "with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off,\n",
      "especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers. “What could\n",
      "we do if he were to leave us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We could go back,” Michael said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could we ever find our way back without him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don’t\n",
      "know how to stop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was\n",
      "to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must\n",
      "come back to their own window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who is to get food for us, John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And even though we\n",
      "became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and\n",
      "things if he is not near to give us a hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly,\n",
      "though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front\n",
      "of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they\n",
      "bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage\n",
      "round Michael’s forehead by this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up\n",
      "there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would\n",
      "suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had\n",
      "no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he\n",
      "had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or\n",
      "he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not\n",
      "be able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really\n",
      "rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect\n",
      "that he will go on remembering us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least\n",
      "not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes\n",
      "as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she\n",
      "had to call him by name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you\n",
      "see me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll\n",
      "remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he\n",
      "showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their\n",
      "way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several\n",
      "times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they\n",
      "would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon\n",
      "he would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.” So with\n",
      "occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the\n",
      "Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more,\n",
      "they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much\n",
      "owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was\n",
      "looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic\n",
      "shores.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There it is,” said Peter calmly.\n",

      "“Where all the arrows are pointing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children,\n",
      "all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of\n",
      "their way before leaving them for the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their\n",
      "first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at\n",
      "once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something\n",
      "long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they\n",
      "were returning home for the holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, there’s the lagoon.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin\n",
      "camp!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they\n",

      "\n",
      "“There, just across the Mysterious River.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he\n",
      "wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not\n",
      "told you that anon fear fell upon them?\n",
      "\n",
      "It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little\n",
      "dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it\n",
      "and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts\n",
      "of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty\n",
      "that you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on.\n",
      "You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over\n",
      "here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was\n",
      "real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker\n",
      "every moment, and where was Nana?\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His\n",
      "careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle\n",
      "went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over\n",
      "the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their\n",
      "feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had\n",
      "become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way\n",
      "through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had\n",
      "beaten on it with his fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his\n",
      "shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his\n",
      "hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that\n",
      "they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he\n",
      "went on again.\n",
      "\n",
      "His courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventure now,” he\n",
      "said casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in\n",
      "gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,” Peter told\n",
      "him. “If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wake up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while he was\n",
      "sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I\n",
      "always do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say! Do you kill many?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked if\n",
      "there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had\n",
      "never known so many.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is captain now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that\n",
      "hated word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jas. Hook?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps\n",
      "only, for they knew Hook’s reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily. “He is the worst\n",
      "of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s him,” said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is he like? Is he big?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is not so big as he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh, all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, I say, what bit?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Then he can’t fight now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, can’t he just!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Left-hander?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Claws!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, John,” said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy who serves under\n",
      "me has to promise, and so must you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John paled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise,” John said loyally.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying\n",
      "with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.\n",
      "Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go\n",
      "round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo.\n",
      "Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us before the\n",
      "darkness came, and got Long Tom out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The big gun?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are\n",
      "near it they are sure to let fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Michael!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three cried simultaneously,\n",
      "but he refused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “and she is\n",
      "rather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all by herself\n",
      "when she is frightened!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a\n",
      "loving little pinch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can’t do.\n",
      "It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the only other thing\n",
      "fairies can’t do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two things worth\n",
      "doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carry her in\n",
      "it.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a\n",
      "pocket between the four of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a happy idea. John’s hat!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John\n",
      "carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently\n",
      "Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he\n",
      "flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated\n",
      "to be under an obligation to Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on\n",
      "in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken\n",
      "once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts\n",
      "drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been\n",
      "the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins\n",
      "sharpening their knives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “If\n",
      "only something would make a sound!” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous\n",
      "crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to\n",
      "cry savagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an\n",
      "island of make-believe and the same island come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found\n",
      "themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air\n",
      "mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t tried yet,” Michael whispered back.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried\n",
      "by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards\n",
      "with no companion but Tinker Bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the\n",
      "hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had\n",
      "planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began\n",
      "to lure Wendy to her destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the\n",
      "other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or\n",
      "the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one\n",
      "feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it\n",
      "must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of\n",
      "Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course\n",
      "understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded\n",
      "kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning “Follow me, and\n",
      "all will be well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and\n",
      "Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know\n",
      "that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so,\n",
      "bewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her\n",
      "doom.\n",

      "Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke\n",
      "into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is\n",
      "better and was always used by Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take\n",
      "an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the\n",
      "redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and\n",
      "lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with\n",
      "the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if\n",
      "you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island\n",
      "seething with life.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as\n",
      "follows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out\n",
      "looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the\n",
      "pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were\n",
      "going round and round the island, but they did not meet because all\n",
      "were going at the same rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night\n",
      "were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of\n",
      "course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when\n",
      "they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins\n",
      "them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins\n",
      "as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them\n",
      "as they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they\n",
      "wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so\n",
      "round and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore\n",
      "become very sure-footed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most\n",
      "unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures\n",
      "than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when\n",
      "he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the\n",
      "opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then\n",
      "when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This\n",
      "ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead\n",
      "of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the\n",
      "humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for\n",
      "you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if\n",
      "accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who\n",
      "is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks\n",
      "you are the most easily tricked of the boys. ’Ware Tinker Bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and\n",
      "he passes by, biting his knuckles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts\n",
      "whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.\n",
      "Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the\n",
      "days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has\n",
      "given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, and\n",
      "so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly,\n",
      "“Stand forth the one who did this thing,” that now at the command he\n",
      "stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the\n",

      "indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was\n",
      "the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.\n",
      "In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of\n",
      "Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career\n",
      "that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his\n",
      "mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke\n",
      "two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his\n",
      "iron claw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As\n",
      "they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace\n",
      "collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one\n",
      "screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has\n",
      "not even taken the cigars from his mouth.\n",
      "\n",

      "win?\n",

      "one of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and\n",
      "their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are\n",
      "scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny\n",
      "tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the\n",
      "Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave\n",
      "of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his\n",
      "progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes\n",
      "Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most\n",
      "beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,\n",
      "coquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would\n",
      "not have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a\n",
      "hatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the\n",
      "slightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy\n",
      "breathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after\n",
      "the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment,\n",
      "however, it constitutes their chief danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their\n",
      "place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,\n",
      "tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from\n",
      "them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the\n",
      "man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues\n",

      "\n",
      "When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic\n",
      "crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the\n",

      "changes its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the\n",
      "danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island\n",
      "was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung\n",
      "themselves down on the sward, close to their underground home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously,\n",
      "though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than\n",
      "their captain.\n",

      "“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in\n",
      "the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some\n",
      "distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he would\n",

      "Cinderella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother\n",
      "must have been very like her.\n",

      "don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my\n",
      "mother one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild\n",
      "things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and\n",
      "it was the grim song:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has\n",
      "darted away to reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the\n",
      "ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal\n",
      "presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be\n",
      "seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would\n",
      "disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note\n",
      "that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow\n",
      "trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home\n",
      "under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many\n",
      "moons. Will he find it tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs\n",
      "disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But\n",
      "an iron claw gripped his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.\n",
      "“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon us. Do\n",

      "\n",
      "“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and tickle him with\n",
      "Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his\n",
      "cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One\n",
      "could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,\n",
      "it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I want to\n",
      "mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain\n",
      "and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it\n",
      "was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but\n",
      "there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo’sun the\n",
      "story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all\n",
      "about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anon he caught the word Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain,\n",
      "Peter Pan. ’Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the hook\n",
      "threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I’ll\n",
      "tear him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook was worth a\n",
      "score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray to have my\n",
      "children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look of pride\n",
      "upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he\n",
      "frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that happened\n",
      "to be passing by.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one crocodile.”\n",
      "He lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has\n",
      "followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking\n",
      "its lips for the rest of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a compliment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want Peter\n",
      "Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his\n",
      "voice. “Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me\n",
      "before this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick\n",
      "tick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and\n",
      "bolt.” He laughed, but in a hollow way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and then he’ll get\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s the fear that haunts\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said, “this\n",
      "seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I’m burning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on\n",
      "the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in\n",
      "their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to\n",
      "ascend. The pirates looked at each other. “A chimney!” they both\n",
      "exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It\n",
      "was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were\n",
      "in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for\n",
      "so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily\n",
      "chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the\n",
      "mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee whispered,\n",
      "fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a\n",
      "curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.\n",
      "“Unrip your plan, captain,” he cried eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and\n",
      "cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.\n",
      "There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The\n",
      "silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door\n",
      "apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the\n",
      "shore of the Mermaids’ Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about\n",
      "there, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will\n",
      "gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don’t know how dangerous\n",
      "’tis to eat rich damp cake.” He burst into laughter, not hollow\n",
      "laughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha, they will die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Smee had listened with growing admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” he cried, and\n",
      "in their exultation they danced and sang:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Avast, belay, when I appear,\n",
      "    By fear they’re overtook;\n",
      "Nought’s left upon your bones when you\n",
      "    Have shaken claws with Hook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound\n",
      "broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a\n",
      "leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it\n",
      "was more distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tick tick tick tick!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo’sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now\n",
      "on the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night\n",
      "were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their\n",
      "midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were\n",
      "hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what can we do, what can we do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their\n",
      "thoughts turned to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them through\n",
      "his legs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy\n",
      "they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long\n",
      "one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in\n",
      "the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring\n",
      "eyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gathered round\n",
      "him eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind of a bird, do you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks so weary, and as it\n",
      "flies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Wendy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birds called\n",
      "Wendies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.\n",
      "But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous\n",
      "fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at\n",
      "her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she\n",
      "touched.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us do\n",
      "what Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows and arrows!”\n",
      "\n",
      "All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with\n",
      "him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be so pleased.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way, Tink,”\n",
      "he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with\n",
      "an arrow in her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy’s body when\n",
      "the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are too late,” he cried proudly, “I have shot the Wendy. Peter\n",
      "will be so pleased with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Overhead Tinker Bell shouted “Silly ass!” and darted into hiding. The\n",
      "others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they\n",
      "looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been\n",
      "beating they would all have heard it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in a scared\n",
      "voice. “I think this must be a lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all whipped off their caps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her to us.” He threw\n",
      "himself sorrowfully on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins, “and you\n",
      "have killed her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a\n",
      "step nearer them they turned from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now\n",
      "that had never been there before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come to me in\n",
      "dreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when at last she\n",
      "really came, I shot her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved slowly away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t go,” they called in pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid of Peter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the\n",
      "heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his\n",
      "return.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But\n",
      "Tootles stood aloof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.\n",
      "“Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then\n",
      "again was silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked\n",
      "it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last a mother for you\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his\n",
      "knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “She flew this\n",
      "way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournful day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her to you,” and\n",
      "when the others would still have hidden her he said, “Back, twins, let\n",
      "Peter see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a\n",
      "little time he did not know what to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she is frightened at\n",
      "being dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of\n",
      "sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would\n",
      "all have been glad to follow if he had done this.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a\n",
      "dagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” he said\n",
      "firmly, “strike true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannot\n",
      "strike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays my hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at\n",
      "Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and\n",
      "listened reverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She lives,” Peter said briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had\n",
      "put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave\n",
      "her. It has saved her life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me see it. Ay,\n",
      "that’s a kiss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so\n",
      "that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer\n",
      "yet, being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing\n",
      "note.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because the Wendy lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had they\n",
      "seen him look so stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more. Begone from\n",
      "me for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not\n",
      "until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,\n",
      "“Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh\n",
      "dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,\n",
      "and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does with ladies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would not be\n",
      "sufficiently respectful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no way out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little house round her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring me each of\n",
      "you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.\n",
      "They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and\n",
      "while they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they\n",
      "dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,\n",
      "moved another step and slept again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana, John, and\n",
      "mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we did fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Peter,” they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He\n",
      "was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how\n",
      "large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for\n",
      "chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her to make supper\n",
      "for us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying\n",
      "branches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see that these boys\n",
      "help in the building of the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Build a house?” exclaimed John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the Wendy,” said Curly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only a girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You? Wendy’s servants!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.\n",
      "“Chairs and a fender first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shall build a\n",
      "house round them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it all comes back\n",
      "to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch a doctor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.\n",
      "But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing\n",
      "John’s hat and looking solemn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you a doctor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that\n",
      "they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were\n",
      "exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had\n",
      "to make-believe that they had had their dinners.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the\n",
      "knuckles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped\n",
      "knuckles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In yonder glade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and he\n",
      "made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment\n",
      "when the glass thing was withdrawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is she?” inquired Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad!” Peter cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give her beef tea\n",
      "out of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned the hat to\n",
      "John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a\n",
      "difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost\n",
      "everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likes best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it. “Oh,\n",
      "lovely!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter. “Wendy, sing\n",
      "the kind of house you would like to have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I had a pretty house,\n",
      "    The littlest ever seen,\n",
      "With funny little red walls\n",
      "    And roof of mossy green.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the\n",
      "branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground\n",
      "was carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke\n",
      "into song themselves:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve built the little walls and roof\n",
      "    And made a lovely door,\n",
      "So tell us, mother Wendy,\n",
      "    What are you wanting more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this she answered greedily:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, really next I think I’ll have\n",
      "    Gay windows all about,\n",
      "With roses peeping in, you know,\n",
      "    And babies peeping out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves\n",
      "were the blinds. But roses—?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roses,” cried Peter sternly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Babies?\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve made the roses peeping out,\n",
      "    The babes are at the door,\n",
      "We cannot make ourselves, you know,\n",
      "    ’Cos we’ve been made before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his\n",
      "own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy\n",
      "within, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode\n",
      "up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle\n",
      "eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it\n",
      "made an excellent knocker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely finished now, they thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “we must have a\n",
      "chimney.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. This gave\n",
      "Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out the\n",
      "bottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to\n",
      "have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke\n",
      "immediately began to come out of the hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to\n",
      "knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressions are awfully\n",
      "important.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all\n",
      "too busy looking their best.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not\n",
      "a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a\n",
      "branch and openly sneering.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a\n",
      "lady, what would she be like?\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off\n",
      "their hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she\n",
      "would look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where am I?” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,” he\n",
      "said rapidly, “for you we built this house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very words they\n",
      "had hoped she would say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we are your children,” cried the twins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O\n",
      "Wendy lady, be our mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’s frightfully\n",
      "fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real\n",
      "experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the only person\n",
      "present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew\n",
      "least. “What we need is just a nice motherly person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside at once, you\n",
      "naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to\n",
      "bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you can\n",
      "squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many\n",
      "joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in\n",
      "the great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that\n",
      "night in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn\n",
      "sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves\n",
      "were on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the\n",
      "darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the\n",
      "chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time\n",
      "he fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on\n",
      "their way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the\n",
      "fairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked\n",
      "Peter’s nose and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and\n",
      "John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at\n",
      "the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was\n",
      "ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up\n",
      "and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you\n",
      "fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at\n",
      "exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out\n",
      "alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\n",
      "action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and\n",
      "nothing can be more graceful.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as\n",
      "carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the\n",
      "clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.\n",
      "Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments\n",
      "or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only\n",
      "available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and\n",
      "after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on\n",
      "fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a\n",
      "whole family in perfect condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to\n",
      "be altered a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as\n",
      "buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under\n",
      "the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all\n",
      "houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to\n",
      "go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming\n",
      "colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in\n",
      "the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,\n",
      "level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high,\n",
      "and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;\n",
      "as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\n",
      "there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was\n",
      "in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across\n",
      "this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended\n",
      "her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down\n",
      "at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in\n",
      "it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict\n",
      "rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned\n",
      "at once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby,\n",
      "and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and\n",
      "long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made\n",
      "of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one\n",
      "recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private\n",
      "apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the\n",
      "house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always\n",
      "kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could\n",
      "have had a more exquisite boudoir and bed-chamber combined. The couch,\n",
      "as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and\n",
      "she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in\n",
      "season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only\n",
      "three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust\n",
      "and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth,\n",
      "and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and\n",
      "Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the\n",
      "thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very\n",
      "contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps\n",
      "inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited,\n",
      "having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those\n",
      "rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole\n",
      "weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was\n",
      "never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the\n",
      "pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she\n",
      "had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never\n",
      "exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe,\n",
      "it all depended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was\n",
      "part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is\n",
      "what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing\n",
      "being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a\n",
      "meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying,\n",
      "but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him\n",
      "that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all\n",
      "gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for\n",
      "herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting\n",
      "double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on\n",
      "their knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a\n",
      "hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am\n",
      "sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.\n",
      "\n",
      "You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she\n",
      "had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into\n",
      "each other’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had\n",
      "left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite\n",
      "impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is\n",
      "calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them\n",

      "about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they\n",
      "would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave\n",
      "her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John\n",
      "remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while\n",
      "Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.\n",
      "These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she\n",
      "tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination\n",
      "papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.\n",
      "The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on\n",
      "joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,\n",
      "writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on\n",
      "another slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary\n",
      "questions—“What was the colour of Mother’s eyes? Which was taller,\n",
      "Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three\n",
      "questions if possible.” “(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words\n",
      "on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother\n",
      "compared. Only one of these to be attempted.” Or “(1) Describe Mother’s\n",

      "what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who\n",
      "replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more\n",
      "hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,\n",
      "and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except\n",
      "Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could\n",

      "\n",
      "Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but\n",
      "about this time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that\n",
      "fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in\n",
      "it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his\n",
      "games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the\n",
      "sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting\n",
      "on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for\n",
      "walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To\n",
      "see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help\n",
      "looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic\n",
      "thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his\n",
      "health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to\n",
      "him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also;\n",
      "otherwise he would have treated them severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never\n",
      "absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might\n",
      "have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then\n",
      "when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might\n",
      "say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.\n",
      "Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed\n",
      "over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling\n",
      "tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many\n",
      "adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself,\n",
      "and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other\n",
      "boys were in them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all\n",
      "would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English\n",
      "Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an\n",
      "average hour on the island. The difficulty is which one to choose.\n",
      "Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a\n",
      "sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter’s\n",
      "peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would\n",
      "suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the\n",
      "balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,\n",
      "“I’m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?” And Tootles answered,\n",
      "“Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and Nibs said, “Redskin; what are you\n",

      "\n",
      "The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was—but we have not decided\n",
      "yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one\n",
      "would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the\n",
      "ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be\n",
      "pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s\n",
      "life in the Mermaids’ Lagoon, and so made her his ally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might\n",
      "eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after\n",
      "another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children,\n",
      "so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone,\n",
      "and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularly\n",
      "of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how\n",
      "the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and\n",
      "Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty\n",
      "story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it\n",
      "we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of\n",
      "course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter\n",
      "adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’s attempt, with the\n",
      "help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a\n",
      "great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and\n",
      "Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we\n",
      "might choose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round\n",
      "him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though\n",
      "he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on\n",
      "breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that\n",
      "the gulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it\n",
      "again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick\n",
      "to the lagoon.\n",

      "If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a\n",

      "if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and\n",
      "the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on\n",
      "fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the\n",
      "nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment;\n",
      "if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the\n",
      "mermaids singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or\n",
      "floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and\n",
      "so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on\n",
      "friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting\n",
      "regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil\n",
      "word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon\n",
      "she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where\n",
      "they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite\n",
      "irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within\n",
      "a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her\n",
      "with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who\n",
      "chatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their\n",
      "tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,\n",
      "when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for\n",
      "mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy\n",
      "had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course\n",
      "Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules\n",
      "about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,\n",
      "however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in\n",
      "extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many\n",
      "colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily\n",
      "from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the\n",
      "rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and\n",
      "the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of\n",
      "these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a\n",
      "pretty sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by\n",
      "themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we\n",
      "have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not\n",
      "above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of\n",
      "hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids\n",
      "adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a\n",
      "rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their\n",
      "doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was\n",
      "make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened\n",
      "in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock was\n",
      "not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how\n",
      "not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with\n",
      "their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was\n",
      "not looking. She was very busy, stitching.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over\n",
      "it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning\n",
      "it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she\n",
      "looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing\n",
      "place seemed formidable and unfriendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as\n",
      "night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent\n",
      "that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?\n",
      "\n",
      "There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’\n",
      "Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them\n",
      "there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is\n",
      "submerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely\n",
      "because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it\n",
      "was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she\n",
      "was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply\n",
      "must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So,\n",
      "though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would\n",
      "not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though\n",
      "her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them\n",
      "to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could\n",
      "sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at\n",
      "once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was\n",
      "playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that\n",
      "smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was\n",
      "to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.\n",
      "Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were\n",
      "itself marooned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in\n",
      "her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger\n",
      "Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her\n",
      "fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her\n",
      "race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written\n",
      "in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the\n",
      "happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter\n",
      "of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.\n",
      "No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of\n",
      "his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to\n",
      "guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see\n",
      "the rock till they crashed into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s; “here’s the\n",
      "rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it\n",
      "and leave her here to drown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the\n",
      "rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and\n",
      "down, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first\n",
      "tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had\n",
      "forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was\n",
      "two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way\n",
      "would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never\n",
      "one to choose the easy way.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice\n",
      "of Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellous imitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had looked for\n",
      "him in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Free!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, captain—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’ll plunge my hook in you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is queer!” Smee gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At once like an eel\n",
      "she slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knew\n",
      "that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray\n",
      "himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was\n",
      "stayed even in the act, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s\n",
      "voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle\n",
      "of surprise instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him\n",
      "he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his\n",
      "hook grip the boat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose\n",
      "dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim\n",
      "away, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also\n",
      "top-heavy with conceit. “Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he\n",
      "whispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad\n",
      "for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He signed to her to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their\n",
      "captain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of\n",
      "profound melancholy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with a\n",
      "hollow moan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He sighs,” said Smee.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He sighs again,” said Starkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at last he spoke passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found a mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O evil day!” cried Starkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!” and always\n",
      "after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be\n",
      "her one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,\n",
      "“What was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,\n",
      "and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I\n",
      "have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was\n",
      "sitting on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that is a mother. What\n",
      "a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the\n",
      "mother desert her eggs? No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent\n",
      "days when—but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but\n",
      "the more suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is\n",
      "hanging about here to help Peter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that haunts me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’ mother and make\n",
      "her our mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it took practical\n",
      "shape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carry them to\n",
      "the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our\n",
      "mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Wendy forgot herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” she cried, and bobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in\n",
      "the wind. “Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is my hand on it,” they both said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And there is my hook. Swear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook\n",

      "“Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried, “dost hear\n",
      "me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He\n",

      "“Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.\n",

      "become, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was\n",
      "not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego\n",
      "slipping from him. “Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the\n",

      "“Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”\n",

      "wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of\n",
      "steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at\n",
      "their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib,\n",
      "but he was himself pinked in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock\n",
      "Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing\n",
      "from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water\n",
      "round him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter\n",
      "that circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock\n",
      "to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite\n",
      "side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather\n",
      "than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a\n",
      "grip met the other’s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their\n",
      "faces were almost touching; so they met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell\n",
      "to they had a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would\n",
      "admit it. After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared.\n",
      "But Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he\n",
      "gnashed his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife\n",
      "from Hook’s belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he\n",
      "was higher up the rock than his foe. It would not have been fighting\n",
      "fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that Hook bit him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made\n",
      "him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is\n",
      "affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he\n",
      "has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After you\n",
      "have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never\n",
      "afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first\n",
      "unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot\n",
      "it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just\n",
      "stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking\n",
      "wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white\n",
      "fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary\n",
      "occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they\n",
      "were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring\n",
      "the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and\n",
      "went home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer\n",
      "came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. “They must be swimming\n",
      "back or flying,” the boys concluded. They were not very anxious,\n",
      "because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because\n",
      "they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault!\n",
      "\n",
      "When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon,\n",
      "and then a feeble cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Help, help!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted\n",
      "and lay on the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the\n",
      "rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that\n",
      "the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he\n",
      "could do no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began\n",
      "pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,\n",
      "woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to\n",
      "tell her the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growing smaller. Soon\n",
      "the water will be over it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not understand even now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must go,” she said, almost brightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he answered faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to tell her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy,\n",
      "without my help?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had to admit that she was too tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "He moaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look how the water is rising.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They\n",
      "thought they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed\n",
      "against Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying\n",
      "timidly, “Can I be of any use?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It\n",
      "had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but next moment he had\n",
      "seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should it not carry\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both of us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her. She\n",
      "clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,\n",
      "Wendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne\n",
      "out of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of\n",
      "light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a\n",
      "sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world:\n",
      "the mermaids calling to the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A\n",
      "tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on\n",
      "the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them,\n",
      "and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the\n",
      "rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him.\n",
      "It was saying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids\n",
      "retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far\n",
      "away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where\n",
      "they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the\n",
      "nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to\n",
      "pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only\n",
      "thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,\n",
      "perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to\n",
      "drift ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon\n",
      "the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,\n",
      "and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to\n",
      "the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece\n",
      "of paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making\n",
      "desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in\n",
      "a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able\n",
      "to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter\n",
      "recognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to\n",
      "give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the\n",
      "bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes\n",
      "tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest\n",
      "of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her\n",
      "what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the\n",
      "other’s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds\n",
      "freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a\n",
      "story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but\n",
      "truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,\n",
      "not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their\n",
      "manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly\n",
      "and distinctly as possible, “and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,\n",
      "but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try\n",
      "to—swim—to—it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Why don’t you let the\n",
      "nest drift as usual?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Peter tried slow and distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I\n",
      "tell you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted\n",
      "hotly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“So are you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by\n",
      "one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up\n",
      "she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks\n",
      "to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his\n",
      "thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to\n",
      "watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and\n",
      "reflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see\n",
      "the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,\n",
      "driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of\n",
      "buried treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and\n",
      "when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds,\n",
      "pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for\n",
      "food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been\n",
      "played upon them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung\n",
      "his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the\n",
      "eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her\n",
      "admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then\n",
      "he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his\n",
      "shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the\n",
      "hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,\n",
      "and he was borne off in another, both cheering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the\n",
      "bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that\n",
      "she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and\n",
      "often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter\n",
      "feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her\n",
      "again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build\n",
      "in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take\n",
      "an airing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground\n",
      "almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the\n",
      "kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest\n",
      "adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so\n",
      "inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up\n",
      "still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in\n",
      "having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the\n",
      "lateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had\n",
      "to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out\n",
      "bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about\n",
      "and carrying their arms in slings.\n",

      "One important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the\n",
      "redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful\n",
      "fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for\n",
      "him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the\n",
      "ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could\n",

      "be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them\n",
      "grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles\n",
      "had pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit\n",
      "back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by\n",
      "raising the right arm politely and saying, “I complain of so-and-so;”\n",

      "\n",
      "She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy\n",
      "load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.\n",

      "“Wendy,” remonstrated Michael, “I’m too big for a cradle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly, “and you\n",

      "house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and\n",
      "dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very\n",

      "on it for the last time.\n",

      "\n",
      "“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they\n",
      "had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do\n",
      "anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People of our figure, Wendy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is only among our own progeny.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True, true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties\n",
      "first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire\n",
      "and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing\n",
      "more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over\n",

      "\n",

      "“Michael takes after you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course, I have\n",
      "now passed my best, but you don’t want to change me, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Wendy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,\n",
      "blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter, what is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is only\n",
      "make-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make me seem so old\n",
      "to be their real father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctly heard his\n",
      "sigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speak firmly, “what are\n",
      "your exact feelings to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme\n",
      "end of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lily is just\n",
      "the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is\n",
      "not my mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we\n",
      "know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then what is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “Perhaps Tinker Bell\n",
      "will tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. “She is\n",
      "an abandoned little creature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out\n",
      "something impudent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she\n",
      "had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the\n",
      "night was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance\n",
      "gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on\n",
      "the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.\n",
      "They sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy\n",
      "song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own\n",
      "shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them,\n",
      "from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the\n",
      "dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It\n",
      "was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the\n",
      "pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may\n",
      "never meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’s\n",
      "good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but\n",
      "the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the\n",
      "others but himself, and he said gloomily:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the\n",
      "end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story\n",
      "they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell\n",
      "this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and\n",
      "possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all\n",
      "still be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we\n",
      "shall see what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen, then,” said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at\n",
      "her feet and seven boys in the bed. “There was once a gentleman—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had rather he had been a lady,” Curly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish he had been a white rat,” said Nibs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quiet,” their mother admonished them. “There was a lady also, and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, mummy,” cried the first twin, “you mean that there is a lady also,\n",
      "don’t you? She is not dead, is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Are you glad, John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you glad, Nibs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you glad, Twins?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are glad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that she should\n",
      "have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr. Darling, and her name\n",
      "was Mrs. Darling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what do you think\n",
      "they had?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is descendants?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you are one, Twin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Descendants are only children,” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three children had a\n",
      "faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and\n",
      "chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, where the lost\n",
      "children are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “I don’t know how\n",
      "it is, but I just thought they did!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost children called\n",
      "Tootles?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents\n",
      "with all their children flown away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering the\n",
      "feelings of the unhappy parents one jot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Think of the empty beds!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oo!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the second twin. “Do\n",
      "you, Nibs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m frightfully anxious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told them\n",
      "triumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to the part\n",
      "that Peter hated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.\n",
      "“Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew that the mother\n",
      "would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so\n",
      "they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did they ever go back?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,\n",
      "“take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves the twist\n",
      "that makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, and who\n",
      "is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn’t\n",
      "know.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can it be—yes—no—it is—the fair Wendy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown\n",
      "to man’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards, ‘there is the\n",
      "window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime\n",
      "faith in a mother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummy and daddy,\n",
      "and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair\n",
      "narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip\n",
      "like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children\n",
      "are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then\n",
      "when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it,\n",
      "confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "So great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt they\n",
      "could afford to be callous for a bit longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he\n",
      "uttered a hollow groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill.\n",
      "She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it,\n",
      "Peter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then what kind is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;\n",
      "and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother would always\n",
      "keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and\n",
      "moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had\n",
      "forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my\n",
      "bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it\n",
      "scared them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure mothers are like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child\n",
      "when he should give in. “Wendy, let us go home,” cried John and Michael\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” she said, clutching them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they\n",
      "called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother,\n",
      "and that it is only the mothers who think you can’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come\n",
      "to her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and she\n",
      "said to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessary\n",
      "arrangements?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass\n",
      "the nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind\n",
      "the parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against\n",
      "grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he\n",
      "got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at\n",
      "the rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a\n",
      "saying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies;\n",
      "and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he\n",
      "returned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his\n",
      "absence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys\n",
      "had advanced upon her threateningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shan’t let her go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s keep her prisoner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, chain her up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped\n",
      "his silliness and spoke with dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But the first who\n",
      "does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him\n",
      "severely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The\n",
      "others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once\n",
      "that they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the\n",
      "Neverland against her will.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked the redskins to\n",
      "guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Peter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be\n",
      "obeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really\n",
      "been sitting up in bed listening for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on a journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she\n",
      "was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in\n",
      "still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,\n",
      "whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’s chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dress at once I will\n",
      "open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your _negligée_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t getting up?” she\n",
      "cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now\n",
      "equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were\n",
      "dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also\n",
      "because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which\n",
      "they had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feel almost sure\n",
      "I can get my father and mother to adopt you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was\n",
      "thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in the middle of\n",
      "his jump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will only mean having\n",
      "a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens\n",
      "on first Thursdays.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it for\n",
      "granted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely\n",
      "cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert\n",
      "their dearest ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they\n",
      "rushed to get their things.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, “I\n",
      "am going to give you your medicine before you go.” She loved to give\n",
      "them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was\n",
      "only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle\n",
      "and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On\n",
      "this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as\n",
      "she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart\n",
      "sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not going with you,\n",
      "Wendy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Peter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and\n",
      "down the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run\n",
      "about after him, though it was rather undignified.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To find your mother,” she coaxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He\n",
      "could do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered\n",
      "only their bad points.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say I was old,\n",
      "and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Peter—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the others had to be told.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter isn’t coming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their\n",
      "backs, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if\n",
      "Peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them\n",
      "go.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” he said\n",
      "darkly, “I hope you will like them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most\n",
      "of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said,\n",
      "were they not noodles to want to go?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;” and\n",
      "he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for\n",
      "he had something important to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would\n",
      "prefer a thimble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,\n",
      "lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you will take your medicine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,\n",
      "however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are\n",
      "you ready, Tinker Bell?” he called out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then lead the way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at\n",
      "this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the\n",
      "redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with\n",
      "shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths\n",
      "opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were\n",
      "extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly\n",
      "blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert\n",
      "them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had\n",
      "slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\n",
      "unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins\n",
      "fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin\n",
      "who attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before\n",
      "the dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its\n",
      "lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on\n",
      "the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream\n",
      "runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await\n",
      "the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and\n",
      "treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just\n",
      "before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts\n",
      "wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The\n",
      "brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has\n",
      "dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a\n",
      "wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is\n",
      "answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the\n",
      "coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and\n",
      "the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live\n",
      "through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly\n",
      "calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the\n",
      "night is marching.\n",
      "\n",
      "That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in\n",
      "disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and\n",
      "their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.\n",
      "They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of\n",
      "their tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the\n",
      "marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates\n",
      "were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and\n",
      "in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot\n",
      "of ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the\n",
      "home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their\n",
      "mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a\n",
      "stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish\n",
      "himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped\n",
      "out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins\n",
      "folded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is\n",
      "to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home,\n",
      "awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which\n",
      "they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were\n",
      "found by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by\n",
      "such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to\n",
      "have paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that\n",
      "grey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked\n",
      "appears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would\n",
      "not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with\n",
      "no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters\n",
      "as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot\n",
      "helplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they\n",
      "gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and\n",
      "they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell\n",
      "from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory.\n",
      "No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy\n",
      "hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father’s sons they\n",
      "acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx\n",
      "that would have been hard to break had they risen quickly, but this\n",
      "they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is\n",
      "written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the\n",
      "presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the\n",
      "pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,\n",
      "not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then,\n",
      "indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and\n",
      "the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a\n",
      "fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not\n",
      "all unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to\n",
      "disturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust\n",
      "were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell\n",
      "to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way\n",
      "through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for\n",
      "the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the\n",
      "proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in\n",
      "judging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should\n",
      "perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to\n",
      "follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element\n",
      "of surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the\n",
      "whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold\n",
      "a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,\n",
      "and the fell genius with which it was carried out.\n",
      "\n",
      "What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?\n",
      "Fain would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their\n",
      "cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and\n",
      "squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation\n",
      "must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a\n",
      "dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit\n",
      "as in substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\n",
      "come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he\n",
      "should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their\n",
      "band, but chiefly Pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred\n",
      "of him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this\n",
      "and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the\n",
      "crocodile’s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so\n",
      "relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about\n",
      "Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his\n",
      "courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not—. There is no\n",
      "beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have\n",
      "got to tell. It was Peter’s cockiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at\n",
      "night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured\n",
      "man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs\n",
      "down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest\n",
      "ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple\n",
      "to ram them down with poles.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang\n",
      "of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all\n",
      "appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as\n",
      "their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium\n",
      "above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce\n",
      "gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their\n",
      "fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which side had won?\n",
      "\n",
      "The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the\n",
      "question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the tom-tom; it is\n",
      "always their sign of victory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.\n",
      "“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly of\n",
      "course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook\n",
      "signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an\n",
      "understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,\n",
      "had this simple man admired Hook so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen\n",
      "gleefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian victory!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black\n",
      "hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to\n",
      "Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were\n",
      "swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the\n",
      "trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and\n",
      "silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to\n",
      "arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence\n",
      "to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree\n",
      "he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.\n",

      "How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be\n",
      "rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a\n",
      "morass. Again Hook’s genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that\n",

      "into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others\n",
      "fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange\n",

      "play refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue\n",
      "eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound\n",
      "from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house\n",
      "under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.\n",
      "Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly’s\n",
      "tree, with his dagger in his hand?\n",
      "\n",

      "stood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a\n",
      "moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like\n",
      "a candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,\n",
      "biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became\n",
      "accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees\n",
      "took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long\n",
      "sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter\n",
      "fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a\n",
      "little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no\n",
      "doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not\n",
      "care. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy.\n",
      "Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still\n",
      "more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know\n",
      "that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly\n",
      "cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed\n",
      "instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful\n",
      "than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from\n",
      "these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I\n",
      "think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been\n",
      "Wendy’s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,\n",
      "soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer\n",
      "to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not\n",
      "know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this\n",
      "occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped\n",
      "over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\n",
      "of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the\n",
      "little pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the\n",
      "tree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of\n",
      "compassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he\n",
      "loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no\n",
      "mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted,\n",
      "the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his\n",
      "better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one\n",
      "thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The\n",
      "open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a\n",
      "personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one\n",
      "may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.\n",
      "They steeled Hook’s heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred\n",
      "pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt\n",
      "at the sleeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in\n",
      "darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered\n",
      "an obstacle, the door of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the\n",
      "aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he\n",
      "found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his\n",
      "disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter’s\n",
      "face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung\n",
      "himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?\n",
      "\n",
      "But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s\n",
      "medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\n",
      "straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a\n",
      "dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that\n",
      "had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow\n",
      "liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent\n",
      "poison in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but it\n",
      "was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided\n",
      "glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely\n",
      "to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim,\n",
      "and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged\n",
      "at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.\n",
      "Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around\n",
      "him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the\n",
      "night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to\n",
      "himself, stole away through the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement\n",
      "in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten\n",
      "o’clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened\n",
      "by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his\n",
      "tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt\n",
      "for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "For long there was no answer: then again the knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached\n",
      "the door. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture, so that he\n",
      "could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me in, Peter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her\n",
      "face flushed and her dress stained with mud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him three guesses.\n",
      "“Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long\n",
      "as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the\n",
      "capture of Wendy and the boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on\n",
      "the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he\n",
      "thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\n",
      "medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hand closed on the fatal draught.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as\n",
      "he sped through the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is poisoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the\n",
      "dark secret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left no\n",
      "room for doubt. The cup was poisoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fell asleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one\n",
      "of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,\n",
      "and drained it to the dregs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I am going to\n",
      "be dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why, Tink?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on\n",
      "his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear\n",
      "“You silly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt\n",
      "near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and\n",
      "he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears\n",
      "so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.\n",
      "Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well\n",
      "again if children believed in fairies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was\n",
      "night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the\n",
      "Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys\n",
      "and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung\n",
      "from trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you believe?” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she\n",
      "wasn’t sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think?” she asked Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands; don’t let Tink\n",
      "die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many clapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few beasts hissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to\n",
      "their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink\n",
      "was saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed,\n",
      "then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than\n",
      "ever. She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would\n",
      "have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now to rescue Wendy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,\n",
      "begirt with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his\n",
      "perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had\n",
      "hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted\n",
      "should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low\n",
      "would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing\n",
      "birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.\n",
      "\n",
      "He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange\n",
      "names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at\n",
      "which happily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not\n",
      "be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of\n",
      "snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the\n",
      "island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent\n",
      "carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest lore that\n",
      "he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that\n",
      "in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he\n",
      "had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance, Curly would\n",
      "drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important\n",
      "place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could\n",
      "not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound,\n",
      "not a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the\n",

      "\n",
      "He swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across\n",

      "question.\n",

      "good form?\n",
      "\n",

      "sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped\n",
      "down his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew\n",
      "his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, envy not Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as if\n",

      "it.\n",

      "“No little children to love me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him\n",
      "before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he\n",

      "the conviction that all children feared him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that\n",
      "night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them\n",
      "and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with\n",
      "his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on\n",
      "his spectacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,\n",
      "but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his\n",
      "mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the\n",
      "sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made\n",
      "him so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself—“Good form?”\n",
      "\n",

      "all?\n",

      "like a cut flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly\n",
      "relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to\n",
      "his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of\n",
      "water had passed over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor in you;” and at once\n",

      "snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon\n",

      "of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be\n",
      "prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a\n",
      "somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be\n",
      "the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for\n",
      "it, but make constant use of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think my mother\n",

      "\n",
      "He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t think so,” as if\n",

      "\n",
      "Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and\n",

      "\n",
      "They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco\n",

      "brought up.\n",
      "\n",
      "No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the\n",
      "boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all\n",
      "that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was\n",
      "not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written\n",
      "with your finger “Dirty pig”; and she had already written it on\n",

      "course, save for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you are to see\n",
      "your children walk the plank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had\n",
      "soiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a\n",
      "hasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt\n",
      "that he nearly fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he called gloatingly, “for a\n",

      "\n",
      "At this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dear boys,”\n",

      "\n",
      "But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almost\n",

      "\n",
      "It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to\n",
      "the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they\n",
      "were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would\n",
      "walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they\n",
      "could stare and shiver only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward\n",
      "Wendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the\n",
      "boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never\n",
      "heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something\n",
      "else instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all heard it—pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was\n",
      "blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded,\n",
      "but toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him\n",
      "alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as\n",
      "if he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly\n",
      "thought, “The crocodile is about to board the ship!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no\n",
      "intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully\n",
      "alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell:\n",
      "but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its\n",
      "guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound\n",
      "as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and\n",
      "it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was\n",
      "coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of\n",
      "the boys so that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the\n",
      "crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the\n",
      "Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid.\n",
      "It was Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might\n",
      "rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our\n",
      "noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,\n",
      "we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t\n",
      "know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come\n",
      "that night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the\n",
      "island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had\n",
      "seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it,\n",
      "but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he\n",
      "thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a\n",
      "fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter\n",
      "began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and\n",
      "he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the\n",
      "crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one\n",
      "unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,\n",
      "and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what\n",
      "it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again\n",
      "ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a\n",
      "fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs\n",
      "encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new\n",
      "element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human\n",
      "of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this\n",
      "time.” He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without\n",
      "knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for\n",
      "to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had\n",
      "not occurred to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a\n",
      "mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with\n",
      "Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the\n",
      "ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and\n",
      "he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it\n",
      "himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. “How clever of\n",
      "me!” he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into\n",
      "applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the\n",
      "forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by\n",
      "your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the\n",
      "ill-fated pirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.\n",
      "Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and\n",
      "the carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence.\n",
      "How long has it taken?\n",
      "\n",
      "“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)\n",
      "\n",
      "None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the\n",
      "cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look\n",
      "round. They could hear each other’s distressed breathing now, which\n",
      "showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. “All’s\n",
      "still again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently\n",
      "that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,\n",
      "and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating the boys more\n",

      "villainous ditty:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,\n",
      "    You walks along it so,\n",

      "    To Davy Jones below!”\n",
      "\n",
      "To terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of\n",

      "before you walk the plank?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteously\n",
      "that every pirate smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in the cabin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They\n",
      "followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed\n",
      "his song, his dogs joining in with him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,\n",

      "\n",
      "What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song\n",
      "was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the\n",
      "ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well\n",
      "understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than\n",
      "the screech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” cried Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.\n",
      "He tottered out, haggard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook, towering\n",
      "over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” replied Cecco in a hollow\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almost gibbering, “but\n",
      "there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both\n",
      "were seen by Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetch me out\n",
      "that doodle-doo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,\n",
      "no”; but Hook was purring to his claw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more\n",
      "singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a\n",
      "crow.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “’S’death and odds fish,” he\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “I wonder if it\n",

      "\n",
      "“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly, and again\n",

      "“Four,” said Slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemen say mutiny?”\n",
      "Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, “I’ll\n",
      "bring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said, and sped into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,\n",
      "but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something!” echoed Mullins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,\n",
      "and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are\n",
      "superstitious, and Cookson cried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s\n",
      "accurst is when there’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards the pirate craft\n",
      "last. Had he a tail, captain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “that when he\n",
      "comes it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one after\n",
      "another took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this the children\n",
      "could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his\n",
      "prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion. Open the cabin door\n",
      "and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If\n",
      "they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none\n",
      "the worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his\n",
      "bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin\n",
      "and the door was closed on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face\n",
      "the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the\n",
      "mast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it\n",
      "was for the reappearance of Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which\n",
      "he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their\n",
      "manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they\n",
      "could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds, and\n",
      "then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off\n",
      "together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, “Hook or me this\n",
      "time.” So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal\n",
      "herself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her\n",
      "cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great\n",
      "breath and crowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the\n",
      "cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but\n",
      "like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew\n",
      "that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never\n",
      "quailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s a Jonah aboard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi’ a\n",
      "woman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’s gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s. “It’s\n",
      "worth trying,” they said doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at the\n",
      "figure in the cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissed jeeringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s one,” replied the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spoke\n",
      "Peter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ’twas that had been\n",
      "undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he\n",
      "failed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another\n",
      "moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the\n",
      "pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the\n",
      "onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and\n",
      "thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of\n",
      "the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the\n",
      "defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose\n",
      "their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in\n",
      "dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight,\n",
      "but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that\n",
      "they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords\n",
      "of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of\n",
      "weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously\n",
      "counting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who\n",
      "seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of\n",
      "fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a\n",
      "match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and\n",
      "again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,\n",
      "and was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his\n",
      "sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man is mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others\n",
      "drew back and formed a ring around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering\n",
      "slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all my doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage\n",
      "to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with\n",
      "dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge\n",
      "that got past his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill\n",
      "stead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his\n",
      "inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced\n",
      "him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a\n",
      "favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his\n",
      "astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he\n",
      "sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this\n",
      "time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging\n",
      "fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose\n",
      "peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell\n",
      "from Hook’s hand, and he was at Peter’s mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited\n",
      "his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a\n",
      "tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker\n",
      "suspicions assailed him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird\n",
      "that has broken out of the egg.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook\n",
      "that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the\n",
      "very pinnacle of good form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible\n",
      "sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but\n",
      "Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of\n",
      "the danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer\n",
      "asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form\n",
      "before it was cold forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown to pieces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, now, he thought, true form will show.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,\n",
      "and calmly flung it overboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he\n",
      "was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he\n",
      "was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying\n",
      "around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck\n",
      "striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it\n",
      "was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for\n",
      "good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were\n",
      "right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his\n",
      "socks were right.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.\n",
      "\n",
      "For we have come to his last moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger\n",
      "poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He\n",
      "did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely\n",
      "stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little\n",
      "mark of respect from us at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he\n",
      "stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through\n",
      "the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter\n",
      "kick instead of stab.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus perished James Hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his\n",
      "figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two\n",
      "reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him\n",
      "nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and\n",
      "Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making\n",
      "a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had\n",
      "feared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though\n",
      "watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she\n",
      "became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered\n",
      "delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;\n",
      "and then she took them into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch which\n",
      "was hanging on a nail. It said “half-past one!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got\n",
      "them to bed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all\n",
      "but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell\n",
      "asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night,\n",
      "and cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for\n",
      "there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among them,\n",
      "with a rope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned\n",
      "pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up,\n",
      "with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and\n",
      "second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the\n",
      "mast, and lived in the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed himself to\n",
      "the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to\n",
      "them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but\n",
      "that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they\n",
      "snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the\n",
      "note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp\n",
      "orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for\n",
      "the mainland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if this\n",
      "weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,\n",
      "after which it would save time to fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour\n",
      "of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they\n",
      "dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant\n",
      "obedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking\n",
      "perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that\n",
      "Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy’s suspicions, but that there\n",
      "might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will,\n",
      "she was making for him out of some of Hook’s wickedest garments. It was\n",
      "afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this\n",
      "suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook’s cigar-holder in his mouth and\n",
      "one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held\n",
      "threateningly aloft like a hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that\n",
      "desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless\n",
      "flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this\n",
      "time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we\n",
      "had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would\n",
      "probably have cried, “Don’t be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and\n",
      "keep an eye on the children.” So long as mothers are like this their\n",
      "children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful\n",
      "occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance\n",
      "of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants.\n",
      "Why on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left\n",
      "them in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well\n",
      "right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the\n",
      "week-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in\n",
      "need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way\n",
      "Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in\n",
      "the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed\n",
      "they will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the\n",
      "surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They\n",
      "have been planning it out on the ship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout\n",
      "of joy, Nana’s leap through the air to embrace them first, when what\n",
      "they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil\n",
      "it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly\n",
      "Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may\n",
      "exclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here are those boys again.” However,\n",
      "we should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.\n",
      "Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for\n",
      "depriving the children of their little pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by\n",
      "telling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of\n",
      "delight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, if you look at it in that way!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What other way is there in which to look at it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say\n",
      "extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one\n",
      "of them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have\n",
      "things ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never\n",
      "leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we\n",
      "are to her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here\n",
      "we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody\n",
      "really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that\n",
      "some of them will hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine\n",
      "and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.\n",
      "Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained\n",
      "Nana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of\n",
      "course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might\n",
      "have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness\n",
      "off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion’s courage to\n",
      "do what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with\n",
      "anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all\n",
      "fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dear\n",
      "invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my own one, this is the place for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the\n",
      "kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but\n",
      "whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave\n",
      "up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud\n",
      "George Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his\n",
      "wife of their children and all their pretty ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into\n",
      "the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,\n",
      "which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way\n",
      "at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen\n",
      "if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this\n",
      "man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he\n",
      "must have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when\n",
      "the young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat\n",
      "courteously to any lady who looked inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward\n",
      "meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was\n",
      "touched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls\n",
      "scaled it to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class\n",
      "of papers, and society invited him to dinner and added, “Do come in the\n",
      "kennel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery\n",
      "awaiting George’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look\n",
      "at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone\n",
      "now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say\n",
      "nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy\n",
      "children, she couldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has\n",
      "fallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is\n",
      "almost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she\n",
      "had a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I\n",
      "like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her\n",
      "sleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles\n",
      "of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that\n",
      "they are on the way. Let’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names;\n",
      "and there is no one in the room but Nana.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her\n",
      "mistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was\n",
      "brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see\n",
      "that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no\n",
      "imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of\n",
      "such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were\n",
      "still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faint flush;\n",
      "but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.\n",
      "Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some\n",
      "time he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling\n",
      "of this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she\n",
      "hoped his head would not be turned by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if I had been a\n",
      "weak man!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorse as ever,\n",
      "aren’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a\n",
      "kennel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are not\n",
      "enjoying it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love!”\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he\n",
      "curled round in the kennel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nursery piano?” and as\n",
      "she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, “And shut\n",
      "that window. I feel a draught.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open\n",
      "for them, always, always.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the\n",
      "day-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept,\n",
      "Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement\n",
      "planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have\n",
      "happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter\n",
      "and Tinker Bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter’s first words tell all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it! That’s right.\n",
      "Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will\n",
      "think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had\n",
      "exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink\n",
      "to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head\n",
      "all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then\n",
      "he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to\n",
      "Tink, “It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as\n",
      "my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my\n",
      "mother’s was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes\n",
      "bragged about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knew it\n",
      "was saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he cried exultantly,\n",
      "“You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw\n",
      "that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were\n",
      "sitting on her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but I won’t, not\n",
      "\n",
      "He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had\n",
      "taken their place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He was angry with\n",
      "her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t both have her,\n",
      "lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He\n",
      "ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He\n",
      "skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as\n",
      "if she were inside him, knocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the\n",
      "window. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws\n",
      "of nature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and he flew away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after\n",
      "all, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the\n",
      "floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already\n",
      "forgotten his home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think I have been\n",
      "here before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed across to look into\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a man inside it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.\n",
      "“He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with such frank\n",
      "disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have\n",
      "been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael\n",
      "say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in\n",
      "the kennel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, “he\n",
      "used not to sleep in the kennel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’t remember the old life\n",
      "as well as we thought we did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John, “not\n",
      "to be here when we come back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it is!” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who was\n",
      "surely sleepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse, “it\n",
      "was quite time we came back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands over her eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently,\n",
      "had a better plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as\n",
      "if we had never been away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her\n",
      "husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for\n",
      "her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not\n",
      "believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often\n",
      "in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around\n",
      "her still.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had\n",
      "nursed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three\n",
      "of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother!” Wendy cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s John,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her arms for the\n",
      "three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they\n",
      "did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of\n",
      "bed and run to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke\n",
      "to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been\n",
      "a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who\n",
      "was staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that\n",
      "other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at\n",
      "the one joy from which he must be for ever barred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were\n",
      "waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they\n",
      "had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair,\n",
      "because they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in\n",
      "a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they\n",
      "were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their\n",
      "eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling\n",
      "also, but they forgot about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.\n",
      "Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a\n",
      "rather large number.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t do things by halves,” a\n",
      "grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you think\n",
      "we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go\n",
      "away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew\n",
      "he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing\n",
      "himself in such an unfavourable light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to\n",
      "have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked\n",
      "his consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his\n",
      "own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly. “Do you think\n",
      "he is a cypher, Curly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was\n",
      "absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the\n",
      "drawing-room if they fitted in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am not sure that\n",
      "we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s all the same.\n",
      "Hoop la!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoop la!”\n",
      "and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget\n",
      "whether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all\n",
      "fitted in.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not\n",
      "exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so\n",
      "that she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she\n",
      "did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, are you going away?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “that you would like to\n",
      "say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About me, Peter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp\n",
      "eye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,\n",
      "and would like to adopt him also.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then to an office?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon I would be a man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” he told her\n",
      "passionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s mother, if I was to\n",
      "wake up and feel there was a beard!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in a beard;” and\n",
      "Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But where are you going to live?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it\n",
      "high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her\n",
      "grip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was now\n",
      "quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the\n",
      "first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies\n",
      "there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees;\n",
      "and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue\n",
      "ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sitting by the\n",
      "fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall have Tink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” she reminded him a\n",
      "little tartly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Peter, you know it matters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I, mummy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he does so need a mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So do you, my love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness\n",
      "merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this\n",
      "handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his\n",
      "spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent\n",
      "arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;\n",
      "but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of\n",
      "time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him\n",
      "is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew\n",
      "this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time\n",
      "comes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’s\n",
      "kiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite\n",
      "easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class\n",
      "III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.\n",
      "Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they\n",
      "saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was\n",
      "too late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or\n",
      "me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly\n",
      "gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so\n",
      "that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions\n",
      "by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased to\n",
      "tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when\n",
      "they let go of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their\n",
      "hats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was\n",
      "that they no longer believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;\n",
      "so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first\n",
      "year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves\n",
      "and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice\n",
      "how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say\n",
      "about himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but\n",
      "new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of the\n",
      "arch enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how you killed him and saved\n",
      "all our lives?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to\n",
      "see her he said, “Who is Tinker Bell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not\n",
      "remember.\n",
      "\n",

      "Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to\n",
      "Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was\n",
      "exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning\n",
      "in the little house on the tree tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because\n",
      "the old one simply would not meet; but he never came.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there\n",
      "is no such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael\n",
      "had not been crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he\n",
      "never knew he had missed a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer\n",
      "she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was\n",
      "untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years\n",
      "came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met\n",
      "again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a\n",
      "little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown\n",
      "up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes\n",
      "to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker\n",
      "than other girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely\n",
      "worth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and\n",
      "Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag\n",
      "and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady\n",
      "of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming\n",
      "out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who\n",
      "doesn’t know any story to tell his children was once John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think\n",
      "that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be\n",
      "written in ink but in a golden splash.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from\n",
      "the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions.\n",
      "When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan.\n",
      "She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember\n",
      "in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It\n",
      "was Jane’s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per\n",
      "cents from Wendy’s father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs.\n",
      "Darling was now dead and forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her nurse’s;\n",
      "and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old\n",
      "age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\n",
      "very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children\n",
      "except herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy’s\n",
      "part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane’s\n",
      "invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her own, thus\n",
      "making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do we see now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with a feeling\n",
      "that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a little girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me, how time\n",
      "flies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew when you were a\n",
      "little girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever\n",
      "did really fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dear old days when I could fly!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the\n",
      "way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do they forget the way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only\n",
      "the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and\n",
      "innocent and heartless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter\n",
      "flew in looking for his shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with soap, and\n",
      "when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\n",
      "better than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\n",
      "what did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you crying?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\n",
      "pirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under\n",
      "the ground, and the little house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes! which did you like best of all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for me,\n",
      "and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile. She\n",
      "was as grown up as that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s crow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like this;” and she did it\n",
      "ever so much better than her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\n",
      "one who heard it awake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lucky you,” said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and\n",
      "the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her\n",
      "bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to\n",
      "see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she\n",
      "sat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and\n",
      "Peter dropped in on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still\n",
      "had all his first teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not\n",
      "daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\n",
      "thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might\n",
      "have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\n",
      "possible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John is not here now,” she gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as\n",
      "well as to Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy or girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly away with\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly, “Have\n",
      "you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning\n",
      "times pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have forgotten how to fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll soon teach you again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?” he\n",
      "cried, shrinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see for\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.\n",
      "“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a\n",
      "little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it\n",
      "all, but they were wet-eyed smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and\n",
      "when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he\n",
      "drew back sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” he cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had to tell him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\n",
      "ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You promised not to!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you’re not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she’s not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child\n",
      "with his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on\n",
      "the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort\n",
      "him, though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman\n",
      "now, and she ran out of the room to try to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,\n",
      "and was interested at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo,” said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to the\n",
      "Neverland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post\n",
      "crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room\n",
      "in solemn ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by\n",
      "his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when\n",
      "they gazed at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knows it so\n",
      "well as I.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the\n",
      "shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy rushed to the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants me always\n",
      "to do his spring cleaning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse\n",
      "of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky\n",
      "until they were as small as stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her\n",
      "figure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a\n",
      "common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring\n",
      "cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and\n",
      "takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,\n",
      "to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a\n",
      "daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn; and thus it will go on,\n",

      "polished as a ripe cherry.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had Master Cherry set eyes on the piece of wood than his face\n",
      "beamed with delight, and, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction,\n",
      "he said softly to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This wood has come at the right moment; it will just do to make the leg\n",
      "of a little table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately took a sharp axe with which to remove the bark and the\n",
      "rough surface, but just as he was going to give the first stroke he\n",
      "heard a very small voice say imploringly, \"Do not strike me so hard!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned his terrified eyes all around the room to try and discover\n",
      "where the little voice could possibly have come from, but he saw nobody!\n",
      "He looked under the bench--nobody; he looked into a cupboard that was\n",
      "always shut--nobody; he looked into a basket of shavings and\n",
      "sawdust--nobody; he even opened the door of the shop and gave a glance\n",
      "into the street--and still nobody. Who, then, could it be?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see how it is,\" he said, laughing and scratching his wig, \"evidently\n",
      "that little voice was all my imagination. Let us set to work again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, taking up the axe, he struck a tremendous blow on the piece of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! oh! you have hurt me!\" cried the same little voice dolefully.\n",

      "with fright, his mouth remained open, and his tongue hung out almost to\n",
      "the end of his chin, like a mask on a fountain. As soon as he had\n",
      "recovered the use of his speech he began to say, stuttering and\n",
      "trembling with fear:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where on earth can that little voice have come from that said 'Oh!\n",
      "oh!'? Is it possible that this piece of wood can have learned to cry and\n",
      "to lament like a child? I cannot believe it. This piece of wood is\n",
      "nothing but a log for fuel like all the others, and thrown on the fire\n",
      "it would about suffice to boil a saucepan of beans. How then? Can anyone\n",

      "spluttered and felt as if he were going to faint.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Without loss of time he placed an earthenware saucer on a brazier full\n",

      "egg-shell over it and let the contents drop in. But, instead of the\n",
      "white and the yolk a little chicken popped out very gay and polite.\n",
      "Making a beautiful courtesy it said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A thousand thanks, Master Pinocchio, for saving me the trouble of\n",
      "breaking the shell. Adieu until we meet again. Keep well, and my best\n",
      "compliments to all at home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus saying, it spread its wings, darted through the open window and,\n",
      "flying away, was lost to sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor puppet stood as if he had been bewitched, with his eyes fixed,\n",
      "his mouth open, and the egg-shell in his hand. Recovering, however, from\n",
      "his first stupefaction, he began to cry and scream, and to stamp his\n",
      "feet on the floor in desperation, and amidst his sobs he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, indeed, the Talking-Cricket was right. If I had not run away from\n",
      "home, and if my papa were here, I should not now be dying of hunger! Oh!\n",
      "what a dreadful illness hunger is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as his stomach cried out more than ever and he did not know how to\n",
      "quiet it, he thought he would leave the house and make an excursion in\n",
      "the neighborhood in hopes of finding some charitable person who would\n",
      "give him a piece of bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a wild and stormy night. The thunder was tremendous and the\n",
      "lightning so vivid that the sky seemed on fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio had a great fear of thunder, but hunger was stronger than\n",
      "fear. He therefore closed the house door and made a rush for the\n",
      "village, which he reached in a hundred bounds, with his tongue hanging\n",
      "out and panting for breath like a dog after game.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found it all dark and deserted. The shops were closed, the\n",
      "windows shut, and there was not so much as a dog in the street. It\n",
      "seemed the land of the dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, urged by desperation and hunger, took hold of the bell of a\n",
      "house and began to ring it with all his might, saying to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will bring somebody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it did. A little old man appeared at a window with a night-cap on\n",
      "his head and called to him angrily:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want at such an hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you be kind enough to give me a little bread?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait there, I will be back directly,\" said the little old man, thinking\n",
      "it was one of those rascally boys who amuse themselves at night by\n",
      "ringing the house-bells to rouse respectable people who are sleeping\n",
      "quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After half a minute the window was again opened and the voice of the\n",
      "same little old man shouted to Pinocchio:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come underneath and hold out your cap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio pulled off his cap; but, just as he held it out, an enormous\n",
      "basin of water was poured down on him, soaking him from head to foot as\n",
      "if he had been a pot of dried-up geraniums.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned home like a wet chicken, quite exhausted with fatigue and\n",
      "hunger; and, having no longer strength to stand, he sat down and rested\n",
      "his damp and muddy feet on a brazier full of burning embers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he fell asleep, and whilst he slept his feet, which were\n",
      "wooden, took fire, and little by little they burnt away and became\n",
      "cinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio continued to sleep and to snore as if his feet belonged to\n",
      "some one else. At last about daybreak he awoke because some one was\n",
      "knocking at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is there?\" he asked, yawning and rubbing his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is I!\" answered a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio recognized Geppetto's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Pinocchio, whose eyes were still half shut from sleep, had not as\n",
      "yet discovered that his feet were burnt off. The moment, therefore, that\n",
      "he heard his father's voice he slipped off his stool to run and open the\n",
      "door; but, after stumbling two or three times, he fell his whole length\n",
      "on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the noise he made in falling was as if a sack of wooden ladles had\n",
      "been thrown from a fifth story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Open the door!\" shouted Geppetto from the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear papa, I cannot,\" answered the puppet, crying and rolling about on\n",
      "the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why can't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because my feet have been eaten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who has eaten your feet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cat,\" said Pinocchio, seeing the cat, who was amusing herself by\n",
      "making some shavings dance with her forepaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Open the door, I tell you!\" repeated Geppetto. \"If you don't, when I\n",
      "get into the house you shall have the cat from me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot stand up, believe me. Oh, poor me! poor me! I shall have to\n",
      "walk on my knees for the rest of my life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Geppetto, believing that all this lamentation was only another of the\n",
      "puppet's tricks, thought of a means of putting an end to it, and,\n",
      "climbing up the wall, he got in at the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very angry and at first he did nothing but scold; but when he saw\n",
      "his Pinocchio lying on the ground and really without feet he was quite\n",
      "overcome. He took him in his arms and began to kiss and caress him, and\n",
      "to say a thousand endearing things to him, and as the big tears ran down\n",
      "his cheeks he said, sobbing:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My little Pinocchio! how did you manage to burn your feet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, papa, but it has been such a dreadful night that I shall\n",
      "remember it as long as I live. It thundered and lightened, and I was\n",
      "very hungry, and then the Talking-Cricket said to me: 'It serves you\n",
      "right; you have been wicked and you deserve it,' and I said to him:\n",
      "'Take care, Cricket!' and he said: 'You are a puppet and you have a\n",
      "wooden head,' and I threw the handle of a hammer at him, and he died,\n",
      "but the fault was his, for I didn't wish to kill him, and the proof of\n",
      "it is that I put an earthenware saucer on a brazier of burning embers,\n",
      "but a chicken flew out and said: 'Adieu until we meet again, and many\n",
      "compliments to all at home': and I got still more hungry, for which\n",
      "reason that little old man in a night-cap, opening the window, said to\n",
      "me: 'Come underneath and hold out your hat,' and poured a basinful of\n",
      "water on my head, because asking for a little bread isn't a disgrace, is\n",
      "it? and I returned home at once, and because I was always very hungry I\n",
      "put my feet on the brazier to dry them, and then you returned, and I\n",
      "found they were burnt off, and I am always hungry, but I have no longer\n",
      "any feet! Oh! oh! oh! oh!\" And poor Pinocchio began to cry and to roar\n",
      "so loudly that he was heard five miles off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geppetto, who from all this jumbled account had only understood one\n",
      "thing, which was that the puppet was dying of hunger, drew from his\n",
      "pocket three pears and, giving them to him, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These three pears were intended for my breakfast, but I will give them\n",
      "to you willingly. Eat them, and I hope they will do you good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you wish me to eat them, be kind enough to peel them for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peel them?\" said Geppetto, astonished. \"I should never have thought, my\n",
      "boy, that you were so dainty and fastidious. That is bad! In this world\n",
      "we should accustom ourselves from childhood to like and to eat\n",
      "everything, for there is no saying to what we may be brought. There are\n",
      "so many chances!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are no doubt right,\" interrupted Pinocchio, \"but I will never eat\n",
      "fruit that has not been peeled. I cannot bear rind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So good Geppetto peeled the three pears and put the rind on a corner of\n",
      "the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having eaten the first pear in two mouthfuls, Pinocchio was about to\n",
      "throw away the core, but Geppetto caught hold of his arm and said to\n",
      "him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not throw it away; in this world everything may be of use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But core I am determined I will not eat,\" shouted the puppet, turning\n",
      "upon him like a viper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who knows! there are so many chances!\" repeated Geppetto, without\n",
      "losing his temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the three cores, instead of being thrown out of the window, were\n",
      "placed on the corner of the table, together with the three rinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having eaten, or rather having devoured the three pears, Pinocchio\n",
      "yawned tremendously, and then said in a fretful tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am as hungry as ever!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my boy, I have nothing more to give you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, really nothing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have only the rind and the cores of the three pears.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One must have patience!\" said Pinocchio; \"if there is nothing else I\n",
      "will eat a rind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began to chew it. At first he made a wry face, but then one after\n",
      "another he quickly disposed of the rinds: and after the rinds even the\n",
      "cores, and when he had eaten up everything he clapped his hands on his\n",
      "sides in his satisfaction and said joyfully:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! now I feel comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, now,\" observed Geppetto, \"that I was right when I said to you\n",
      "that it did not do to accustom ourselves to be too particular or too\n",
      "dainty in our tastes. We can never know, my dear boy, what may happen to\n",
      "us. There are so many chances!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had the puppet satisfied his hunger than he began to cry and\n",
      "to grumble because he wanted a pair of new feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Geppetto, to punish him for his naughtiness, allowed him to cry and\n",
      "to despair for half the day. He then said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should I make you new feet? To enable you, perhaps, to escape again\n",
      "from home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise you,\" said the puppet, sobbing, \"that for the future I will\n",
      "be good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All boys,\" replied Geppetto, \"when they are bent upon obtaining\n",
      "something, say the same thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise you that I will go to school and that I will study and bring\n",
      "home a good report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All boys, when they are bent on obtaining something, repeat the same\n",
      "story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am not like other boys! I am better than all of them and I always\n",
      "speak the truth. I promise you, papa, that I will learn a trade and that\n",
      "I will be the consolation and the staff of your old age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Geppetto's eyes filled with tears and his heart was sad at seeing his\n",
      "poor Pinocchio in such a pitiable state. He did not say another word,\n",
      "but, taking his tools and two small pieces of well-seasoned wood, he set\n",
      "to work with great diligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than an hour the feet were finished: two little feet--swift,\n",
      "well-knit and nervous. They might have been modelled by an artist of\n",
      "genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geppetto then said to the puppet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut your eyes and go to sleep!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio shut his eyes and pretended to be asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst he pretended to sleep, Geppetto, with a little glue which he\n",
      "had melted in an egg-shell, fastened his feet in their place, and it was\n",
      "so well done that not even a trace could be seen of where they were\n",
      "joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had the puppet discovered that he had feet than he jumped down\n",
      "from the table on which he was lying and began to spring and to cut a\n",
      "thousand capers about the room, as if he had gone mad with the greatness\n",
      "of his delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To reward you for what you have done for me,\" said Pinocchio to his\n",
      "father, \"I will go to school at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But to go to school I shall want some clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Geppetto, who was poor and who had not so much as a penny in his pocket,\n",
      "then made him a little dress of flowered paper, a pair of shoes from the\n",
      "bark of a tree, and a cap of the crumb of bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio ran immediately to look at himself in a crock of water, and he\n",
      "was so pleased with his appearance that he said, strutting about like a\n",
      "peacock:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I look quite like a gentleman!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" answered Geppetto, \"for bear in mind that it is not fine\n",
      "clothes that make the gentleman, but rather clean clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By the bye,\" added the puppet, \"to go to school I am still in\n",
      "want--indeed, I am without the best thing, and the most important.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no spelling-book.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are right: but what shall we do to get one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is quite easy. We have only to go to the bookseller's and buy it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have got none.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither have I,\" added the good old man, very sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio, although he was a very merry boy, became sad also,\n",
      "because poverty, when it is real poverty, is understood by\n",
      "everybody--even by boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, patience!\" exclaimed Geppetto, all at once rising to his feet,\n",
      "and putting on his old corduroy coat, all patched and darned, he ran out\n",
      "of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned shortly, holding in his hand a spelling-book for Pinocchio,\n",
      "but the old coat was gone. The poor man was in his shirt-sleeves and out\n",
      "of doors it was snowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the coat, papa?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have sold it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you sell it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I found it too hot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio understood this answer in an instant, and unable to restrain\n",
      "the impulse of his good heart he sprang up and, throwing his arms around\n",
      "Geppetto's neck, he began kissing him again and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as it stopped snowing Pinocchio set out for school with his fine\n",
      "spelling-book under his arm. As he went along he began to imagine a\n",
      "thousand things in his little brain and to build a thousand castles in\n",
      "the air, one more beautiful than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, talking to himself, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today at school I will learn to read at once; then tomorrow I will\n",
      "begin to write, and the day after tomorrow to figure. Then, with my\n",
      "acquirements, I will earn a great deal of money, and with the first\n",
      "money I have in my pocket I will immediately buy for my papa a beautiful\n",
      "new cloth coat. But what am I saying? Cloth, indeed! It shall be all\n",
      "made of gold and silver, and it shall have diamond buttons. That poor\n",
      "man really deserves it, for to buy me books and have me taught he has\n",
      "remained in his shirt-sleeves. And in this cold! It is only fathers who\n",
      "are capable of such sacrifices!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst he was saying this with great emotion, he thought that he heard\n",
      "music in the distance that sounded like fifes and the beating of a big\n",
      "drum: Fi-fie-fi, fi-fi-fi; zum, zum, zum.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped and listened. The sounds came from the end of a cross street\n",
      "that led to a little village on the seashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can that music be? What a pity that I have to go to school, or\n",
      "else--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he remained irresolute. It was, however, necessary to come to a\n",
      "decision. Should he go to school? or should he go after the fifes?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today I will go and hear the fifes, and tomorrow I will go to school,\"\n",
      "finally decided the young scapegrace, shrugging his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more he ran the nearer came the sounds of the fifes and the beating\n",
      "of the big drum: Fi-fi-fi; zum, zum, zum, zum.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he found himself in the middle of a square quite full of people,\n",
      "who were all crowded round a building made of wood and canvas, and\n",
      "painted a thousand colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that building?\" asked Pinocchio, turning to a little boy who\n",
      "belonged to the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Read the placard--it is all written--and then you will know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would read it willingly, but it so happens that today I don't know\n",
      "how to read.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bravo, blockhead! Then I will read it to you. The writing on that\n",
      "placard in those letters red as fire is:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has the play begun long?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is beginning now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much does it cost to go in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A dime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, who was in a fever of curiosity, lost all control of himself,\n",
      "and without any shame he said to the little boy to whom he was talking:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you lend me a dime until tomorrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would lend it to you willingly,\" said the other, \"but it so happens\n",
      "that today I cannot give it to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will sell you my jacket for a dime,\" the puppet then said to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think that I could do with a jacket of flowered paper? If\n",
      "there were rain and it got wet, it would be impossible to get it off my\n",
      "back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you buy my shoes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They would only be of use to light the fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much will you give me for my cap?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That would be a wonderful acquisition indeed! A cap of bread crumb!\n",
      "There would be a risk of the mice coming to eat it whilst it was on my\n",
      "head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio was on thorns. He was on the point of making another offer,\n",

      "remorseful. At last he said:\n",

      "\"Will you give me a dime for this new spelling-book?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a boy and I don't buy from boys,\" replied his little interlocutor,\n",

      "\n",

      "their shoulders, they carried him in triumph before the footlights.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment out came the showman. He was very big, and so ugly that\n",
      "the sight of him was enough to frighten anyone. His beard was as black\n",
      "as ink, and so long that it reached from his chin to the ground. I need\n",
      "only say that he trod upon it when he walked. His mouth was as big as an\n",
      "oven, and his eyes were like two lanterns of red glass with lights\n",
      "burning inside them. He carried a large whip made of snakes and foxes'\n",
      "tails twisted together, which he cracked constantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his unexpected appearance there was a profound silence: no one dared\n",
      "to breathe. A fly might have been heard in the stillness. The poor\n",
      "puppets of both sexes trembled like so many leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why have you come to raise a disturbance in my theater?\" asked the\n",

      "fine sheep, preparing for his supper, was turning slowly on the spit in\n",
      "front of the fire. As there was not enough wood to finish roasting and\n",
      "browning it, he called Harlequin and Punch, and said to them:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring that puppet here: you will find him hanging on a nail. It seems\n",
      "to me that he is made of very dry wood and I am sure that if he were\n",

      "\n",
      "At first Harlequin and Punch hesitated; but, appalled by a severe glance\n",
      "from their master, they obeyed. In a short time they returned to the\n",

      "like an apron. On the whole, however, he had not a bad heart. In proof\n",
      "of this, when he saw poor Pinocchio brought before him, struggling and\n",
      "screaming \"I will not die, I will not die!\" he was quite moved and felt\n",
      "very sorry for him. He tried to hold out, but after a little he could\n",
      "stand it no longer and he sneezed violently. When he heard the sneeze,\n",
      "Harlequin, who up to that moment had been in the deepest affliction and\n",
      "bowed down like a weeping willow, became quite cheerful and, leaning\n",
      "towards Pinocchio, he whispered to him softly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good news, brother. The showman has sneezed and that is a sign that he\n",

      "\n",
      "Most men, when they feel compassion for somebody, either weep or at\n",

      "he was really overcome, had the habit of sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had sneezed, the showman, still acting the ruffian, shouted to\n",
      "Pinocchio:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have done crying! Your lamentations have given me a pain in my stomach.\n",
      "I feel a spasm that almost--Etchoo! etchoo!\" and he sneezed again twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you!\" said Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you! And your papa and your mamma, are they still alive?\" asked\n",
      "Fire-Eater.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Papa, yes; my mamma I have never known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who can say what a sorrow it would be for your poor old father if I\n",
      "were to have you thrown amongst those burning coals! Poor old man! I\n",
      "pity him! Etchoo! etchoo! etchoo!\" and he sneezed again three times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you\" said Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you! All the same, some compassion is due to me, for as you see I\n",
      "have no more wood with which to finish roasting my mutton, and, to tell\n",
      "you the truth, under the circumstances you would have been of great use\n",
      "to me! However, I have had pity on you, so I must have patience. Instead\n",
      "of you I will burn under the spit one of the puppets belonging to my\n",
      "company. Ho there, gendarmes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this call two wooden gendarmes immediately appeared. They were very\n",
      "long and very thin, and had on cocked hats, and held unsheathed swords\n",
      "in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The showman said to them in a hoarse voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take Harlequin, bind him securely, and then throw him on the fire to\n",
      "burn. I am determined that my mutton shall be well roasted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Only imagine that poor Harlequin! His terror was so great that his legs\n",
      "bent under him, and he fell with his face on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this agonizing sight Pinocchio, weeping bitterly, threw himself at\n",
      "the showman's feet and, bathing his long beard with his tears, he began\n",
      "to say, in a supplicating voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have pity, Sir Fire-Eater!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here there are no sirs,\" the showman answered severely.\n",

      "\"Have pity, Sir Knight!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here there are no knights!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Have pity, Excellence!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what do you want from me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I implore you to pardon poor Harlequin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For him there can be no pardon. As I have spared you he must be put on\n",
      "the fire, for I am determined that my mutton shall be well roasted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case,\" cried Pinocchio proudly, rising and throwing away his\n",

      "Bind me and throw me amongst the flames. No, it is not just that poor\n",
      "Harlequin, my true friend, should die for me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These words, pronounced in a loud, heroic voice, made all the puppets\n",
      "who were present cry. Even the gendarmes, although they were made of\n",
      "wood, wept like two newly born lambs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire-Eater at first remained as hard and unmoved as ice, but little by\n",
      "little he began to melt and to sneeze. And, having sneezed four or five\n",
      "times, he opened his arms affectionately and said to Pinocchio:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a good, brave boy! Come here and give me a kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio ran at once and, climbing like a squirrel up the showman's\n",
      "beard, he deposited a hearty kiss on the point of his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then the pardon is granted?\" asked poor Harlequin in a faint voice that\n",
      "was scarcely audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pardon is granted!\" answered Fire-Eater; he then added, sighing and\n",
      "shaking his head:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must have patience! Tonight I shall have to resign myself to eat the\n",
      "mutton half raw; but another time, woe to him who displeases me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the news of the pardon the puppets all ran to the stage and, having\n",
      "lighted the lamps and chandeliers as if for a full-dress performance,\n",
      "they began to leap and to dance merrily. At dawn they were still\n",
      "dancing.\n",

      "\n",
      "The following day Fire-Eater called Pinocchio to one side and asked him:\n",

      "\"What is your father's name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Geppetto.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Gain much? Why, he has never a penny in his pocket. Only think, in\n",

      "to sell the only coat he had to wear--a coat that, between patches and\n",
      "darns, was not fit to be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor devil! I feel almost sorry for him! Here are five gold pieces. Go\n",
      "at once and take them to him with my compliments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio was overjoyed and thanked the showman a thousand times. He\n",
      "embraced all the puppets of the company one by one, even to the\n",
      "gendarmes, and set out to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had not gone far when he met on the road a Fox lame of one foot,\n",
      "and a Cat blind of both eyes, and they were going along helping each\n",
      "other like good companions in misfortune. The Fox, who was lame, walked\n",
      "leaning on the Cat; and the Cat, who was blind, was guided by the Fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-day, Pinocchio,\" said the Fox, greeting him politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you come to know my name?\" asked the puppet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I have become a gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gentleman--you!\" said the Fox, and he began to laugh rudely and\n",
      "scornfully. The Cat also began to laugh, but to conceal it she combed\n",
      "her whiskers with her forepaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Splash! Splash! They fell Into the Very Middle of the\n",
      "Ditch]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is little to laugh at,\" cried Pinocchio angrily. \"I am really\n",
      "sorry to make your mouth water, but if you know anything about it, you\n",
      "can see that these are five gold pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pulled out the money that Fire-Eater had given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the jingling of the money the Fox, with an involuntary movement,\n",
      "stretched out the paw that seemed crippled, and the Cat opened wide two\n",
      "eyes that looked like two green lanterns. It is true that she shut them\n",
      "again, and so quickly that Pinocchio observed nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now,\" asked the Fox, \"what are you going to do with all that\n",
      "money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First of all,\" answered the puppet, \"I intend to buy a new coat for my\n",
      "papa, made of gold and silver, and with diamond buttons; and then I will\n",
      "buy a spelling-book for myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes indeed, for I wish to go to school to study in earnest.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Look at me!\" said the Cat. \"Through my foolish passion for study I have\n",
      "lost the sight of both my eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment a white Blackbird, that was perched on the hedge by the\n",
      "road, began his usual song, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pinocchio, don't listen to the advice of bad companions; if you do you\n",
      "will repent it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Blackbird! If only he had not spoken! The Cat, with a great leap,\n",
      "sprang upon him, and without even giving him time to say \"Oh!\" ate him\n",
      "in a mouthful, feathers and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having eaten him and cleaned her mouth she shut her eyes again and\n",
      "feigned blindness as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Blackbird!\" said Pinocchio to the Cat, \"why did you treat him so\n",
      "badly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did it to give him a lesson. He will learn another time not to\n",
      "meddle in other people's conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They had gone almost half-way when the Fox, halting suddenly, said to\n",
      "the puppet:\n",

      "\"Would you like to double your money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what way?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The way is easy enough. Instead of returning home you must go with us.\"\n",

      "\"And where do you wish to take me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the land of the Owls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio reflected a moment, and then he said resolutely:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I will not go. I am already close to the house, and I will return\n",
      "home to my papa, who is waiting for me. Who can tell how often the poor\n",
      "old man must have sighed yesterday when I did not come back! I have\n",
      "indeed been a bad son, and the Talking-Cricket was right when he said:\n",
      "'Disobedient boys never come to any good in the world.' I have found it\n",
      "to be true, for many misfortunes have happened to me. Even yesterday in\n",
      "Fire-Eater's house I ran the risk--Oh! it makes me shudder only to think\n",
      "of it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" said the Fox, \"you are quite decided to go home? Go, then,\n",
      "and so much the worse for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the worse for you!\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think well of it, Pinocchio, for you are giving a kick to fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To fortune!\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Between today and tomorrow your five sovereigns would have become two\n",
      "thousand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two thousand!\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how is it possible that they could become so many?\" asked\n",
      "Pinocchio, remaining with his mouth open from astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will explain it to you at once,\" said the Fox. \"You must know that in\n",
      "the land of the Owls there is a sacred field called by everybody the\n",
      "Field of Miracles. In this field you must dig a little hole, and you put\n",
      "into it, we will say, one gold sovereign. You then cover up the hole\n",
      "with a little earth; you must water it with two pails of water from the\n",
      "fountain, then sprinkle it with two pinches of salt, and when night\n",
      "comes you can go quietly to bed. In the meanwhile, during the night, the\n",
      "gold piece will grow and flower, and in the morning when you get up and\n",
      "return to the field, what do you find? You find a beautiful tree laden\n",
      "with as many gold sovereigns as a fine ear of corn has grains in the\n",
      "month of June.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So that,\" said Pinocchio, more and more bewildered, \"supposing I buried\n",
      "my five sovereigns in that field, how many should I find there the\n",
      "following morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is an exceedingly easy calculation,\" replied the Fox, \"a\n",
      "calculation that you can make on the ends of your fingers. Every\n",
      "sovereign will give you an increase of five hundred; multiply five\n",
      "hundred by five, and the following morning will find you with two\n",
      "thousand five hundred shining gold pieces in your pocket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! how delightful!\" cried Pinocchio, dancing for joy. \"As soon as ever\n",
      "I have obtained those sovereigns, I will keep two thousand for myself\n",
      "and the other five hundred I will make a present of to you two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A present to us?\" cried the Fox with indignation and appearing much\n",
      "offended. \"What are you dreaming of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you dreaming of?\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do not work,\" said the Fox, \"for interest: we work solely to enrich\n",
      "others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Others!\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What good people!\" thought Pinocchio to himself, and, forgetting there\n",
      "and then his papa, the new coat, the spelling-book, and all his good\n",
      "resolutions, he said to the Fox and the Cat:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Let us stop here a little,\" said the Fox, \"that we may have something\n",

      "consequence, for I don't believe in assassins--I have never believed in\n",
      "them. For me, I think that assassins have been invented purposely by\n",
      "papas to frighten boys who want to go out at night. Besides, supposing I\n",
      "was to come across them here in the road, do you imagine they would\n",
      "frighten me? Not the least in the world. I should go to meet them and\n",
      "cry: 'Gentlemen assassins, what do you want with me? Remember that with\n",
      "me there is no joking. Therefore go about your business and be quiet!'\n",

      "\n",
      "Then he tried to escape. But he had not gone a step when he felt himself\n",
      "seized by the arm and heard two horrid, sepulchral voices saying to him:\n",

      "\"Your money or your life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, not being able to answer in words, owing to the money that\n",
      "was in his mouth, made a thousand low bows and a thousand pantomimes. He\n",
      "tried thus to make the two muffled figures, whose eyes were only visible\n",
      "through the holes in their sacks, understand that he was a poor puppet,\n",
      "and that he had not as much as a counterfeit nickel in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, now! Less nonsense and out with the money!\" cried the two\n",
      "brigands threateningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the puppet made a gesture with his hands to signify: \"I have none.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deliver up your money or you are dead,\" said the tallest of the\n",

      "\"Dead!\" repeated the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And after we have killed you, we will also kill your father!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Also your father!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no, not my poor papa!\" cried Pinocchio in a despairing voice,\n",
      "and as he said it the sovereigns clinked in his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! you rascal! Then you have hidden your money under your tongue! Spit\n",

      "\n",
      "And one of them seized the puppet by the end of his nose, and the other\n",
      "took him by the chin, and began to pull them brutally, the one up and\n",
      "the other down, to force him to open his mouth. But it was all to no\n",
      "purpose. Pinocchio's mouth seemed to be nailed and riveted together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the shorter assassin drew out an ugly knife and tried to put it\n",
      "between his lips like a lever or chisel. But Pinocchio, as quick as\n",
      "lightning, caught his hand with his teeth, and with one bite bit it\n",
      "clear off and spat it out. Imagine his astonishment when instead of a\n",
      "hand he perceived that a cat's paw lay on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encouraged by this first victory he used his nails to such purpose that\n",
      "he succeeded in liberating himself from his assailants, and, jumping the\n",
      "hedge by the roadside, he began to fly across the country. The assassins\n",
      "ran after him like two dogs chasing a hare, and the one who had lost a\n",
      "paw ran on one leg, and no one ever knew how he managed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a race of some miles Pinocchio could go no more. Giving himself\n",
      "up for lost, he climbed the trunk of a very high pine tree and seated\n",
      "himself in the topmost branches. The assassins attempted to climb after\n",
      "him, but when they had reached half-way up they slid down again and\n",
      "arrived on the ground with the skin grazed from their hands and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were not to be beaten by so little; collecting a quantity of\n",
      "dry wood, they piled it beneath the pine and set fire to it. In less\n",
      "time than it takes to tell, the pine began to burn and to flame like a\n",
      "candle blown by the wind. Pinocchio, seeing that the flames were\n",
      "mounting higher every instant, and not wishing to end his life like a\n",
      "roasted pigeon, made a stupendous leap from the top of the tree and\n",
      "started afresh across the fields and vineyards. The assassins followed\n",
      "him, and kept behind him without once giving up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day began to break and they were still pursuing him. Suddenly\n",
      "Pinocchio found his way barred by a wide, deep ditch full of stagnant\n",
      "water the color of coffee. What was he to do? \"One! two! three!\" cried\n",
      "the puppet, and, making a rush, he sprang to the other side. The\n",
      "assassins also jumped, but not having measured the distance\n",
      "properly--splash! splash! they fell into the very middle of the ditch.\n",
      "Pinocchio, who heard the plunge and the splashing of the water, shouted\n",
      "out, laughing, and without stopping:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fine bath to you, gentleman assassins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he felt convinced that they were drowned, when, turning to look, he\n",
      "perceived that, on the contrary, they were both running after him, still\n",
      "enveloped in their sacks, with the water dripping from them as if they\n",
      "had been two hollow baskets.\n",

      "Turning, however, his eyes in every direction, he saw, at some distance,\n",
      "a small house as white as snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If only I had breath to reach that house,\" he said to himself, \"perhaps\n",
      "I should be saved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, without delaying an instant, he recommenced running for his life\n",
      "through the wood, and the assassins after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, after a desperate race of nearly two hours, he arrived quite\n",
      "breathless at the door of the house, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knocked again with great violence, for he heard the sound of steps\n",
      "approaching him and the heavy panting of his persecutors. The same\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing that knocking was useless, he began in desperation to kick and\n",
      "pommel the door with all his might. The window then opened and a\n",
      "beautiful Child appeared at it. She had blue hair and a face as white as\n",
      "a waxen image; her eyes were closed and her hands were crossed on her\n",
      "breast. Without moving her lips in the least, she said, in a voice that\n",
      "seemed to come from the other world:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In this house there is no one. They are all dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then at least open the door for me yourself,\" shouted Pinocchio, crying\n",

      "\"I am dead also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dead? Then what are you doing there at the window?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am waiting for the bier to come to carry me away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said this she immediately disappeared and the window was closed\n",
      "again without the slightest noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! beautiful Child with blue hair,\" cried Pinocchio, \"open the door,\n",
      "for pity's sake! Have compassion on a poor boy pursued by assas--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he could not finish the word, for he felt himself seized by the\n",
      "collar and the same two horrible voices said to him threateningly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall not escape from us again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet, seeing death staring him in the face, was taken with such a\n",
      "violent fit of trembling that the joints of his wooden legs began to\n",
      "creak, and the sovereigns hidden under his tongue to clink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, then,\" demanded the assassins, \"will you open your mouth--yes or\n",
      "no? Ah! no answer? Leave it to us: this time we will force you to open\n",
      "it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, drawing out two long, horrid knives as sharp as razors,\n",
      "clash!--they attempted to stab him twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the puppet, luckily for him, was made of very hard wood; the knives\n",
      "therefore broke into a thousand pieces and the assassins were left with\n",
      "the handles in their hands, staring at each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see what we must do,\" said one of them. \"He must be hung! let us hang\n",
      "him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us hang him!\" repeated the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without loss of time they tied his arms behind him, passed a running\n",
      "noose round his throat, and hung him to the branch of a tree called the\n",
      "Big Oak.\n",
      "\n",
      "They then sat down on the grass and waited for his last struggle. But at\n",
      "the end of three hours the puppet's eyes were still open, his mouth\n",
      "closed, and he was kicking more than ever.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Little by little his eyes began to grow dim, but although he felt that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To my belief the puppet is already quite dead; but, if unfortunately he\n",

      "Pinocchio, who up to that moment had lain immovable, like a real piece\n",

      "\"Where is the lump of sugar?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment the door of the room flew open and four rabbits as black\n",
      "as ink entered carrying on their shoulders a little bier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want with me?\" cried Pinocchio, sitting up in bed in a\n",
      "great fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have come to take you,\" said the biggest rabbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To take me? But I am not yet dead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not yet? but you have only a few minutes to live, as you have\n",
      "refused the medicine that would have cured you of the fever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Fairy, Fairy!\" the puppet then began to scream, \"give me the\n",

      "will not die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, taking the tumbler in both hands, he emptied it at a gulp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must have patience!\" said the rabbits; \"this time we have made our\n",

      "they left the room, grumbling and murmuring between their teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, a few minutes afterwards, Pinocchio jumped down from the bed\n",
      "quite well, because wooden puppets have the privilege of being seldom\n",
      "ill and of being cured very quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fairy, seeing him running and rushing about the room as gay and as\n",
      "lively as a young cock, said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then my medicine has really done you good?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good? I should think so! It has restored me to life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why on earth did you require so much persuasion to take it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you see that we boys are all like that! We are more afraid of\n",
      "medicine than of the illness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Disgraceful! Boys ought to know that a good remedy taken in time may\n",
      "save them from a serious illness, and perhaps even from death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but another time I shall not require so much persuasion. I shall\n",
      "remember those black rabbits with the bier on their shoulders and then I\n",
      "shall immediately take the tumbler in my hand, and down it will go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, come here to me and tell me how it came about that you fell into\n",
      "the hands of those assassins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, the showman, Fire-Eater, gave me some gold pieces and said to\n",
      "me: 'Go, and take them to your father!' and instead I met on the road a\n",
      "Fox and a Cat, who said to me: 'Would you like those pieces of gold to\n",
      "become a thousand or two? Come with us and we will take you to the Field\n",
      "of Miracles,' and I said: 'Let us go.' And they said: 'Let us stop at\n",
      "the inn of The Red Craw-Fish,' and after midnight they left. And when I\n",
      "awoke I found that they were no longer there, because they had gone\n",
      "away. Then I began to travel by night, for you cannot imagine how dark\n",
      "it was; and on that account I met on the road two assassins in charcoal\n",
      "sacks who said to me: 'Out with your money,' and I said to them: 'I have\n",
      "got none,' because I had hidden the four gold pieces in my mouth, and\n",
      "one of the assassins tried to put his hand in my mouth, and I bit his\n",
      "hand off and spat it out, but instead of a hand it was a cat's paw. And\n",
      "the assassins ran after me, and I ran, and ran, until at last they\n",
      "caught me and tied me by the neck to a tree in this wood, and said to\n",
      "me: 'Tomorrow we shall return here and then you will be dead with your\n",
      "mouth open and we shall be able to carry off the pieces of gold that you\n",
      "have hidden under your tongue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the four pieces--where have you put them?\" asked the Fairy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have lost them!\" said Pinocchio, but he was telling a lie, for he had\n",
      "them in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had scarcely told the lie when his nose, which was already long, grew\n",
      "at once two inches longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And where did you lose them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the wood near here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this second lie his nose went on growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you have lost them in the wood near here,\" said the Fairy, \"we will\n",
      "look for them and we shall find them: because everything that is lost in\n",
      "that wood is always found.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! now I remember all about it,\" replied the puppet, getting quite\n",
      "confused; \"I didn't lose the four gold pieces, I swallowed them whilst I\n",
      "was drinking your medicine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this lie his nose grew to such an extraordinary length that poor\n",
      "Pinocchio could not move in any direction. If he turned to one side he\n",
      "struck his nose against the bed or the window-panes, if he turned to the\n",
      "other he struck it against the walls or the door, if he raised his head\n",
      "a little he ran the risk of sticking it into one of the Fairy's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Fairy looked at him and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you laughing at?\" asked the puppet, very confused and anxious\n",
      "at finding his nose growing so prodigiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am laughing at the lie you have told.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how can you possibly know that I have told a lie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lies, my dear boy, are found out immediately, because they are of two\n",
      "sorts. There are lies that have short legs, and lies that have long\n",
      "noses. Your lie, as it happens, is one of those that have a long nose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, not knowing where to hide himself for shame, tried to run out\n",
      "of the room; but he did not succeed, for his nose had increased so much\n",
      "that it could no longer pass through the door.\n",

      "which could no longer pass through the door of the room. This she did to\n",
      "give him a severe lesson, and to correct him of the disgraceful fault of\n",
      "telling lies--the most disgraceful fault that a boy can have. But when\n",
      "she saw him quite disfigured and his eyes swollen out of his head from\n",
      "weeping, she felt full of compassion for him. She therefore beat her\n",
      "hands together and at that signal a thousand large birds called\n",
      "Woodpeckers flew in at the window. They immediately perched on\n",
      "Pinocchio's nose and began to peck at it with such zeal that in a few\n",
      "minutes his enormous and ridiculous nose was reduced to its usual\n",
      "dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a good Fairy you are,\" said the puppet, drying his eyes, \"and how\n",
      "much I love you!\"\n",

      "he will be here tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really?\" shouted Pinocchio, jumping for joy. \"Then, little Fairy, if\n",
      "you consent, I should like to go and meet him. I am so anxious to give a\n",
      "kiss to that poor old man, who has suffered so much on my account, that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go, then, but be careful not to lose yourself. Take the road through\n",
      "the wood and I am sure that you will meet him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio set out, and as soon as he was in the wood he began to run\n",
      "like a kid. But when he had reached a certain spot, almost in front of\n",
      "the Big Oak, he stopped, because he thought he heard people amongst the\n",
      "bushes. In fact, two persons came out on to the road. Can you guess who\n",
      "they were? His two traveling companions, the Fox and the Cat, with whom\n",
      "he had supped at the inn of The Red Craw-Fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, here is our dear Pinocchio!\" cried the Fox, kissing and embracing\n",

      "\"How come you to be here?\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a long story,\" answered the puppet, \"which I will tell you when I\n",
      "have time. But do you know that the other night, when you left me alone\n",
      "at the inn, I met with assassins on the road?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Assassins! Oh, poor Pinocchio! And what did they want?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They wanted to rob me of my gold pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Villains!\" said the Fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Infamous villains!\" repeated the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ran away from them,\" continued the puppet, \"and they followed me,\n",
      "and at last they overtook me and hung me to a branch of that oak tree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio pointed to the Big Oak, which was two steps from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it possible to hear of anything more dreadful?\" said the Fox. \"In\n",
      "what a world we are condemned to live! Where can respectable people like\n",
      "us find a safe refuge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst they were thus talking Pinocchio observed that the Cat was lame\n",
      "of her front right leg, for in fact she had lost her paw with all its\n",
      "claws. He therefore asked her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you done with your paw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat tried to answer, but became confused. Therefore the Fox said\n",
      "immediately:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend is too modest, and that is why she doesn't speak. I will\n",
      "answer for her. I must tell you that an hour ago we met an old wolf on\n",
      "the road, almost fainting from want of food, who asked alms of us. Not\n",
      "having so much as a fish-bone to give him, what did my friend, who has\n",
      "really the heart of a Cæsar, do? She bit off one of her fore paws and\n",
      "threw it to that poor beast that he might appease his hunger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Fox, in relating this, dried a tear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio was also touched and, approaching the Cat, he whispered into\n",
      "her ear:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If all cats resembled you, how fortunate the mice would be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, what are you doing here?\" asked the Fox of the puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am waiting for my papa, whom I expect to arrive every moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And your gold pieces?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have got them in my pocket, all but one that I spent at the inn of\n",
      "The Red Craw-Fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And to think that, instead of four pieces, by tomorrow they might\n",
      "become one or two thousand! Why do you not listen to my advice? Why will\n",
      "you not go and bury them in the Field of Miracles?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today it is impossible; I will go another day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another day it will be too late!\" said the Fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because the field has been bought by a gentleman and after tomorrow no\n",
      "one will be allowed to bury money there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How far off is the Field of Miracles?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not two miles. Will you come with us? In half an hour you will be\n",
      "there. You can bury your money at once, and in a few minutes you will\n",
      "collect two thousand, and this evening you will return with your pockets\n",
      "full. Will you come with us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio thought of the good Fairy, old Geppetto, and the warnings of\n",
      "the Talking-Cricket, and he hesitated a little before answering. He\n",
      "ended, however, by doing as all boys do who have not a grain of sense\n",
      "and who have no heart--he ended by giving his head a little shake and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Let us go: I will come with you.\"\n",

      "that the streets were crowded with dogs who were yawning from hunger,\n",
      "shorn sheep trembling with cold, cocks without combs begging for a grain\n",
      "of Indian corn, large butterflies that could no longer fly because they\n",
      "had sold their beautiful colored wings, peacocks which had no tails and\n",
      "were ashamed to be seen, and pheasants that went scratching about in a\n",
      "subdued fashion, mourning for their brilliant gold and silver feathers\n",
      "gone forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this crowd of beggars and shamefaced creatures some\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here we are,\" said the Fox to the puppet. \"Now stoop down and dig with\n",

      "\"Now, then,\" said the Fox, \"go to that canal close to us, fetch a can of\n",
      "water, and water the ground where you have sowed them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio went to the canal, and, as he had no can, he took off one of\n",
      "his old shoes and filling it with water he watered the ground over the\n",
      "hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there anything else to be done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing else,\" answered the Fox. \"We can now go away. You can return in\n",
      "about twenty minutes and you will find a shrub already pushing through\n",
      "the ground, with its branches quite loaded with money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor puppet, beside himself with joy, thanked the Fox and the Cat a\n",
      "thousand times, and promised them a beautiful present.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We wish for no presents,\" answered the two rascals. \"It is enough for\n",
      "us to have taught you the way to enrich yourself without undergoing hard\n",
      "work, and we are as happy as people out for a holiday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus saying, they took leave of Pinocchio, and, wishing him a good\n",

      "The puppet returned to the town and began to count the minutes one by\n",
      "one, and when he thought that it must be time he took the road leading\n",
      "to the Field of Miracles.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he walked along with hurried steps his heart beat fast--tic, tac,\n",
      "tic, tac--like a drawing-room clock when it is really going well.\n",
      "Meanwhile he was thinking to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if, instead of a thousand gold pieces, I were to find on the\n",
      "branches of the tree two thousand? And instead of two thousand,\n",
      "supposing I found five thousand? and instead of five thousand, that I\n",
      "found a hundred thousand? Oh! what a fine gentleman I should then\n",
      "become! I would have a beautiful palace, a thousand little wooden horses\n",
      "and a thousand stables to amuse myself with, a cellar full of currant\n",
      "wine and sweet syrups, and a library quite full of candies, tarts,\n",
      "plum-cakes, macaroons, and biscuits with cream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst he was building these castles in the air he had arrived in the\n",
      "neighborhood of the field, and he stopped to look about for a tree with\n",
      "its branches laden with money, but he saw nothing. He advanced another\n",
      "hundred steps--nothing; he entered the field and went right up to the\n",
      "little hole where he had buried his sovereigns--and nothing. He then\n",
      "became very thoughtful and, forgetting the rules of society and good\n",
      "manners, he took his hands out of his pocket and gave his head a long\n",
      "scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment he heard an explosion of laughter close to him and,\n",
      "looking up, he saw a large Parrot perched on a tree, who was pruning the\n",
      "few feathers he had left.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why are you laughing?\" asked Pinocchio in an angry voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am laughing because in pruning my feathers I tickled myself under my\n",
      "wings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet did not answer, but went to the canal and, filling the same\n",
      "old shoe full of water, he proceeded to water the earth afresh that\n",
      "covered his gold pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was thus occupied another laugh, still more impertinent than\n",
      "the first, rang out in the silence of that solitary place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once for all,\" shouted Pinocchio in a rage, \"may I know, you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am laughing at those simpletons who believe in all the foolish things\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Are you perhaps speaking of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am speaking of you, poor Pinocchio--of you who are simple\n",
      "enough to believe that money can be sown and gathered in fields in the\n",
      "same way as beans and gourds. I also believed it once and today I am\n",
      "suffering for it. Today--but it is too late--I have at last learned that\n",
      "to put a few pennies honestly together it is necessary to know how to\n",
      "earn them, either by the work of our own hands or by the cleverness of\n",
      "our own brains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't understand you,\" said the puppet, who was already trembling\n",
      "with fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have patience! I will explain myself better,\" rejoined the Parrot. \"You\n",
      "must know, then, that while you were in the town the Fox and the Cat\n",

      "wind. And now he that catches them will be clever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio remained with his mouth open and, not choosing to believe the\n",

      "that he had watered. And he dug, and dug, and dug, and made such a deep\n",
      "hole that a rick of straw might have stood upright in it, but the money\n",
      "was no longer there.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rushed back to the town in a state of desperation and went at once to\n",
      "the Courts of Justice to denounce the two knaves who had robbed him to\n",
      "the judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge was a big ape of the gorilla tribe, an old ape respectable for\n",
      "his age, his white beard, but especially for his gold spectacles without\n",
      "glasses that he was always obliged to wear, on account of an\n",
      "inflammation of the eyes that had tormented him for many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio related in the presence of the judge all the particulars of\n",
      "the infamous fraud of which he had been the victim. He gave the names,\n",
      "the surnames, and other details, of the two rascals, and ended by\n",
      "demanding justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge listened with great benignity; took a lively interest in the\n",
      "story; was much touched and moved; and when the puppet had nothing\n",
      "further to say he stretched out his hand and rang a bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this summons two mastiffs immediately appeared dressed as gendarmes.\n",
      "The judge then, pointing to Pinocchio, said to them:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That poor devil has been robbed of four gold pieces; take him away and\n",
      "put him immediately into prison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet was petrified on hearing this unexpected sentence and tried\n",
      "to protest; but the gendarmes, to avoid losing time, stopped his mouth\n",
      "and carried him off to the lockup.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there he remained for four months--four long months--and he would\n",
      "have remained longer still if a fortunate chance had not released him.\n",
      "The young Emperor who reigned over the town of \"Trap for Blockheads,\"\n",
      "having won a splendid victory over his enemies, ordered great public\n",
      "rejoicings. There were illuminations, fireworks, horse races and\n",
      "velocipede races, and as a further sign of triumph he commanded that the\n",
      "prisons should be opened and all the prisoners freed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the others are to be let out of prison, I will go also,\" said\n",
      "Pinocchio to the jailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not you,\" said the jailor, \"because you do not belong to the\n",
      "fortunate class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Pinocchio, \"I am also a criminal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case you are perfectly right,\" said the jailor, and, taking off\n",
      "his hat and bowing to him respectfully, he opened the prison doors and\n",

      "stopping to take breath he immediately left the town and took the road\n",
      "that led to the Fairy's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "On account of the rainy weather the road had become a marsh into which\n",
      "he sank knee-deep. But the puppet would not give in. Tormented by the\n",
      "desire of seeing his father and his little sister with blue hair again,\n",
      "he ran on like a greyhound, and as he ran he was splashed with mud from\n",
      "head to foot. And he said to himself as he went along: \"How many\n",
      "misfortunes have happened to me. But I deserved them, for I am an\n",
      "obstinate, passionate puppet. I am always bent upon having my own way,\n",
      "without listening to those who wish me well, and who have a thousand\n",
      "times more sense than I have! But from this time forth I am determined\n",
      "to change and to become orderly and obedient. For at last I have seen\n",
      "that disobedient boys come to no good and gain nothing. And has my papa\n",
      "waited for me? Shall I find him at the Fairy's house? Poor man, it is so\n",
      "long since I last saw him: I am dying to embrace him and to cover him\n",
      "with kisses! And will the Fairy forgive me my bad conduct to her? To\n",
      "think of all the kindness and loving care I received from her, to think\n",
      "that if I am now alive I owe it to her! Would it be possible to find a\n",
      "more ungrateful boy, or one with less heart than I have?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst he was saying this he stopped suddenly, frightened to death, and\n",
      "made four steps backwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had he seen?\n",
      "\n",
      "He had seen an immense Serpent stretched across the road. Its skin was\n",
      "green, it had red eyes, and a pointed tail that was smoking like a\n",
      "chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be impossible to imagine the puppet's terror. He walked away to\n",
      "a safe distance and, sitting down on a heap of stones, waited until the\n",
      "Serpent should have gone about its business and left the road clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited an hour; two hours; three hours; but the Serpent was always\n",
      "there, and even from a distance he could see the red light of his fiery\n",
      "eyes and the column of smoke that ascended from the end of his tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Pinocchio, trying to feel courageous, approached to within a few\n",
      "steps, and said to the Serpent in a little soft, insinuating voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me. Sir Serpent, but would you be so good as to move a little to\n",
      "one side--just enough to allow me to pass?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He might as well have spoken to the wall. Nobody moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began again in the same soft voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must know. Sir Serpent, that I am on my way home, where my father\n",
      "is waiting for me, and it is such a long time since I saw him last! Will\n",
      "you, therefore, allow me to continue my road?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited for a sign in answer to this request, but there was none; in\n",
      "fact, the Serpent, who up to that moment had been sprightly and full of\n",
      "life, became motionless and almost rigid. He shut his eyes and his tail\n",
      "ceased smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can he really be dead?\" said Pinocchio, rubbing his hands with delight.\n",
      "He determined to jump over him and reach the other side of the road.\n",
      "But, just as he was going to leap, the Serpent raised himself suddenly\n",
      "on end, like a spring set in motion; and the puppet, drawing back, in\n",
      "his terror caught his feet and fell to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he fell so awkwardly that his head stuck in the mud and his legs\n",
      "went into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sight of the puppet kicking violently with his head in the mud,\n",
      "the Serpent went into convulsions of laughter, and laughed, and laughed,\n",
      "until he broke a blood-vessel in his chest and died. And that time he\n",
      "was really dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio then set off running, in hopes that he should reach the\n",
      "Fairy's house before dark. But before long he began to suffer so\n",
      "dreadfully from hunger that he could not bear it, and he jumped into a\n",
      "field by the wayside, intending to pick some bunches of Muscatel grapes.\n",
      "Oh, that he had never done it!\n",
      "\n",
      "He had scarcely reached the vines when crack--his legs were caught\n",
      "between two cutting iron bars and he became so giddy with pain that\n",
      "stars of every color danced before his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor puppet had been taken in a trap put there to capture some big\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio began to cry and scream, but his tears and groans were\n",
      "useless, for there was not a house to be seen, and not a living soul\n",
      "passed down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last night came on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly from the pain of the trap, that cut his legs, and a little from\n",
      "fear at finding himself alone in the dark in the midst of the fields,\n",
      "the puppet was on the point of fainting. Just at that moment he saw a\n",
      "Firefly flitting over his head. He called to it and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, little Firefly, will you have pity on me and liberate me from this\n",
      "torture?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor boy!\" said the Firefly, stopping and looking at him with\n",
      "compassion; \"but how could your legs have been caught by those sharp\n",
      "irons?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I came into the field to pick two bunches of these Muscatel grapes,\n",
      "and--\"\n",

      "\"But were the grapes yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then who taught you to carry off other people's property?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was so hungry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hunger, my boy, is not a good reason for appropriating what does not\n",
      "belong to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true, that is true!\" said Pinocchio, crying. \"I will never do\n",
      "it again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment their conversation was interrupted by a slight sound of\n",
      "approaching footsteps. It was the owner of the field coming on tiptoe to\n",
      "see if one of the polecats that ate his chickens during the night had\n",
      "been caught in his trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "His astonishment was great when, having brought out his lantern from\n",
      "under his coat, he perceived that instead of a polecat a boy had been\n",
      "taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, little thief,\" said the angry peasant, \"then it is you who carries\n",
      "off my chickens?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it is not I; indeed it is not!\" cried Pinocchio, sobbing. \"I only\n",
      "came into the field to take two bunches of grapes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He who steals grapes is quite capable of stealing chickens. Leave it to\n",
      "me, I will give you a lesson that you will not forget in a hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Opening the trap, he seized the puppet by the collar and carried him to\n",
      "his house as if he had been a young lamb.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the yard in front of the house he threw him roughly on\n",
      "the ground and, putting his foot on his neck, he said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is late and I want to go to bed; we will settle our accounts\n",
      "tomorrow. In the meanwhile, as the dog who kept guard at night died\n",
      "today, you shall take his place at once. You shall be my watch-dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, taking a great collar covered with brass knobs, he strapped it so\n",
      "tightly round his throat that he was not able to draw his head out of\n",
      "it. A heavy chain attached to the collar was fastened to the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it should rain tonight,\" he then said to him, \"you can go and lie\n",
      "down in the kennel; the straw that has served as a bed for my poor dog\n",
      "for the last four years is still there. If unfortunately robbers should\n",
      "come, remember to keep your ears pricked and to bark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After giving him this last injunction the man went into the house, shut\n",
      "the door, and put up the chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Pinocchio remained lying on the ground more dead than alive from\n",
      "the effects of cold, hunger and fear. From time to time he put his hands\n",
      "angrily to the collar that tightened his throat and said, crying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It serves me right! Decidedly, it serves me right! I was determined to\n",
      "be a vagabond and a good-for-nothing. I would listen to bad companions,\n",
      "and that is why I always meet with misfortunes. If I had been a good\n",
      "little boy, as so many are; if I had remained at home with my poor papa,\n",
      "I should not now be in the midst of the fields and obliged to be the\n",
      "watch-dog to a peasant's house. Oh, if I could be born again! But now it\n",
      "is too late and I must have patience!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Relieved by this little outburst, which came straight from his heart, he\n",
      "went into the dog-kennel and fell asleep.\n",

      "He had been sleeping heavily for about two hours when, towards midnight, he\n",
      "was aroused by a whispering of strange voices that seemed to come from the\n",
      "courtyard. Putting the point of his nose out of the kennel, he saw four\n",
      "little beasts with dark fur, that looked like cats, standing consulting\n",
      "together. But they were not cats; they were polecats--carnivorous little\n",
      "animals, especially greedy for eggs and young chickens. One of the\n",
      "polecats, leaving his companions, came to the opening of the kennel and\n",
      "said in a low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening, Melampo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is not Melampo,\" answered the puppet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Then where is Melampo? Where is the old dog who lived in this kennel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He died this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he dead? Poor beast! He was so good. But, judging you by your face,\n",
      "I should say that you were also a good dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, I am not a dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a dog? Then what are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a puppet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you are acting as watch-dog?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is only too true--as a punishment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, I will offer you the same conditions that we made with the\n",
      "deceased Melampo, and I am sure you will be satisfied with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are these conditions?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One night in every week you are to permit us to visit this poultry-yard\n",
      "as we have hitherto done, and to carry off eight chickens. Of these\n",
      "chickens seven are to be eaten by us, and one we will give to you, on\n",
      "the express understanding, however, that you pretend to be asleep, and\n",
      "that it never enters your head to bark and to waken the peasant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did Melampo act in this manner?\" asked Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, and we were always on the best terms with him. Sleep\n",
      "quietly, and rest assured that before we go we will leave by the kennel\n",
      "a beautiful chicken ready plucked for your breakfast tomorrow. Have we\n",
      "understood each other clearly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only too clearly!\" answered Pinocchio, and he shook his head\n",
      "threateningly, as much as to say: \"You shall hear of this shortly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The four polecats, thinking themselves safe, repaired to the\n",
      "poultry-yard, which was close to the kennel, and, having opened the\n",
      "wooden gate with their teeth and claws, they slipped in one by one. But\n",
      "they had only just passed through when they heard the gate shut behind\n",
      "them with great violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Pinocchio who had shut it, and for greater security he put a\n",
      "large stone against it to keep it closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then began to bark, and he barked exactly like a watch-dog: \"Bow-wow,\n",

      "Hearing the barking, the peasant jumped out of bed and, taking his gun,\n",
      "he came to the window and asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are robbers!\" answered Pinocchio.\n",

      "\n",
      "In fact, in less time than it takes to say \"Amen!\" the peasant came\n",
      "down. He rushed into the poultry-yard, caught the polecats, and, having\n",
      "put them into a sack, he said to them in a tone of great satisfaction:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At last you have fallen into my hands! I might punish you, but I am not\n",
      "so cruel. I will content myself instead by carrying you in the morning\n",
      "to the innkeeper of the neighboring village, who will skin and cook you\n",
      "as hares with a sweet and sour sauce. It is an honor that you don't\n",
      "deserve, but generous people like me don't consider such trifles!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then approached Pinocchio and began to caress him, and amongst other\n",
      "things he asked him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you manage to discover the four thieves? To think that Melampo,\n",
      "my faithful Melampo, never found out anything!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet might then have told him the whole story; he might have\n",
      "informed him of the disgraceful conditions that had been made between\n",
      "the dog and the polecats; but he remembered that the dog was dead and he\n",
      "thought to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the good of accusing the dead? The dead are dead, and the best\n",
      "thing to be done is to leave them in peace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the thieves got into the yard, were you asleep or awake?\" the\n",
      "peasant went on to ask him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was asleep,\" answered Pinocchio, \"but the polecats woke me with their\n",
      "chatter and one of them came to the kennel and said to me: 'If you\n",
      "promise not to bark, and not to wake the master, we will make you a\n",
      "present of a fine chicken ready plucked!' To think that they should have\n",
      "had the audacity to make such a proposal to me! For, although I am a\n",
      "puppet, possessing perhaps nearly all the faults in the world, there is\n",
      "one that I certainly will never be guilty of, that of making terms with,\n",
      "and sharing the gains of, dishonest people!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well said, my boy!\" cried the peasant, slapping him on the shoulder.\n",
      "\"Such sentiments do you honor; and as a proof of my gratitude I will at\n",
      "once set you at liberty, and you may return home.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "As soon as Pinocchio was released from the heavy and humiliating weight\n",
      "of the dog-collar he started off across the fields and never stopped\n",
      "until he had reached the high road that led to the Fairy's house. He\n",
      "could see amongst the trees the top of the Big Oak to which he had been\n",
      "hung, but, although he looked in every direction, the little house\n",
      "belonging to the beautiful Child with the blue hair was nowhere visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seized with a sad presentiment, he began to run with all the strength he\n",
      "had left and in a few minutes he reached the field where the little\n",
      "white house had once stood. But it was no longer there. Instead of the\n",
      "house he saw a marble stone, on which were engraved these sad words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I leave you to imagine the puppet's feelings when he had with difficulty\n",
      "spelled out this epitaph. He fell with his face on the ground and,\n",
      "covering the tombstone with a thousand kisses, burst into an agony of\n",
      "tears. He cried all night and when morning came he was still crying,\n",
      "although he had no tears left, and his sobs and lamentations were so\n",
      "acute and heart-breaking that they aroused the echoes in the surrounding\n",
      "hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he wept he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, little Fairy, why did you die? Why did I not die instead of you, I\n",
      "who am so wicked, whilst you were so good? And my papa? Where can he be?\n",
      "Oh, little Fairy, tell me where I can find him, for I want to remain\n",
      "with him always and never leave him again, never again! Oh, little\n",
      "Fairy, tell me that it is not true that you are dead! If you really love\n",
      "your little brother, come to life again. Does it not grieve you to see\n",
      "me alone and abandoned by everybody? If assassins come they will hang me\n",
      "again to the branch of a tree, and then I should die indeed. What do you\n",
      "imagine that I can do here alone in the world? Now that I have lost you\n",
      "and my papa, who will give me food? Where shall I go to sleep at night?\n",
      "Who will make me a new jacket? Oh, it would be better, a hundred times\n",
      "better, for me to die also! Yes, I want to die--oh! oh! oh!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And in his despair he tried to tear his hair, but his hair was made\n",
      "of wood so he could not even have the satisfaction of sticking his\n",
      "fingers into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then a large Pigeon flew over his head and, stopping with distended\n",
      "wings, called down to him from a great height:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, child, what are you doing there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you see? I am crying!\" said Pinocchio, raising his head towards\n",
      "the voice and rubbing his eyes with his jacket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" continued the Pigeon, \"amongst your companions, do you happen\n",
      "to know a puppet who is called Pinocchio?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pinocchio? Did you say Pinocchio?\" repeated the puppet, jumping quickly\n",
      "to his feet. \"I am Pinocchio!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this answer the Pigeon descended rapidly to the ground. He was larger\n",
      "than a turkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you also know Geppetto?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do I know him! He is my poor papa! Has he perhaps spoken to you of me?\n",
      "Will you take me to him? Is he still alive? Answer me, for pity's sake:\n",
      "is he still alive?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I left him three days ago on the seashore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was he doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was building a little boat for himself, to cross the ocean. For more\n",
      "than three months that poor man has been going all round the world\n",
      "looking for you. Not having succeeded in finding you, he has now taken\n",
      "it into his head to go to the distant countries of the New World in\n",
      "search of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How far is it from here to the shore?\" asked Pinocchio breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than six hundred miles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six hundred miles? Oh, beautiful Pigeon, what a fine thing it would be\n",
      "to have your wings!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you wish to go, I will carry you there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On my back. Do you weigh much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I weigh next to nothing. I am as light as a feather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And without waiting for more Pinocchio jumped at once on the Pigeon's\n",
      "back and, putting a leg on each side of him as men do on horseback, he\n",
      "exclaimed joyfully:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gallop, gallop, my little horse, for I am anxious to arrive quickly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pigeon took flight and in a few minutes had soared so high that they\n",
      "almost touched the clouds. Finding himself at such an immense height the\n",
      "puppet had the curiosity to turn and look down; but his head spun round\n",
      "and he became so frightened to save himself from the danger of falling\n",
      "he wound his arms tightly round the neck of his feathered steed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They flew all day. Towards evening the Pigeon said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very thirsty!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am very hungry!\" rejoined Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us stop at that dovecote for a few minutes and then we will\n",
      "continue our journey, so that we may reach the seashore by dawn\n",
      "tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went into a deserted dovecote, where they found nothing but a basin\n",
      "full of water and a basket full of vetch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet had never in his life been able to eat vetch: according to\n",
      "him it made him sick. That evening, however, he ate to repletion, and\n",
      "when he had nearly emptied the basket he turned to the Pigeon and said\n",
      "to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never could have believed that vetch was so good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be assured, my boy,\" replied the Pigeon, \"that when hunger is real, and\n",
      "there is nothing else to eat, even vetch becomes delicious. Hunger\n",
      "knows neither caprice nor greediness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having quickly finished their little meal they recommenced their journey\n",
      "and flew away. The following morning they reached the seashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pigeon placed Pinocchio on the ground and, not wishing to be\n",
      "troubled with thanks for having done a good action, flew quickly away\n",
      "and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shore was crowded with people who were looking out to sea, shouting\n",
      "and gesticulating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has happened?\" asked Pinocchio of an old woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor father who has lost his son has gone away in a boat to search\n",
      "for him on the other side of the water, and today the sea is tempestuous\n",
      "and the little boat is in danger of sinking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the little boat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is out there in a line with my finger,\" said the old woman, pointing\n",
      "to a little boat which, seen at that distance, looked like a nutshell\n",
      "with a very little man in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio fixed his eyes on it and after looking attentively he gave a\n",
      "piercing scream, crying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is my papa! It is my papa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat, meanwhile, beaten by the fury of the waves, at one moment\n",
      "disappeared in the trough of the sea, and the next came again to the\n",
      "surface. Pinocchio, standing on the top of a high rock, kept calling to\n",
      "his father by name, and making every kind of signal to him with his\n",
      "hands, his handkerchief, and his cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, although he was so far off, Geppetto appeared to recognize his son,\n",
      "for he also took off his cap and waved it, and tried by gestures to\n",
      "make him understand that he would have returned if it had been possible,\n",
      "but that the sea was so tempestuous that he could not use his oars or\n",
      "approach the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a tremendous wave rose and the boat disappeared. They waited,\n",
      "hoping it would come again to the surface, but it was seen no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor man!\" said the fishermen who were assembled on the shore;\n",
      "murmuring a prayer, they turned to go home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then they heard a desperate cry and, looking back, they saw a\n",
      "little boy who exclaimed, as he jumped from a rock into the sea:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will save my papa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, being made of wood, floated easily and he swam like a fish.\n",
      "At one moment they saw him disappear under the water, carried down by\n",
      "the fury of the waves, and next he reappeared struggling with a leg or\n",
      "an arm. At last they lost sight of him and he was seen no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, hoping to be in time to help his father, swam the whole\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what a horrible night it was! The rain came down in torrents, it\n",
      "hailed, the thunder was frightful, and the flashes of lightning made it\n",
      "as light as day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards morning he saw a long strip of land not far off. It was an\n",
      "island in the midst of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried his utmost to reach the shore, but it was all in vain. The\n",
      "waves, racing and tumbling over each other, knocked him about as if he\n",
      "had been a stick or a wisp of straw. At last, fortunately for him, a\n",
      "billow rolled up with such fury and impetuosity that he was lifted up\n",
      "and thrown far on to the sands.\n",
      "\n",
      "He fell with such force that, as he struck the ground, his ribs and all\n",
      "his joints cracked, but he comforted himself, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This time also I have made a wonderful escape!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Little by little the sky cleared, the sun shone out in all his splendor,\n",
      "and the sea became as quiet and as smooth as oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet put his clothes in the sun to dry and began to look in every\n",
      "direction in hopes of seeing on the vast expanse of water a little boat\n",
      "with a little man in it. But, although he looked and looked, he could\n",
      "see nothing but the sky, and the sea, and the sail of some ship, but so\n",
      "far away that it seemed no bigger than a fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I only knew what this island was called!\" he said to himself. \"If I\n",
      "only knew whether it was inhabited by civilized people--I mean, by\n",
      "people who have not the bad habit of hanging boys to the branches of the\n",
      "trees. But whom can I ask? Whom, if there is nobody?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea of finding himself alone, alone, all alone, in the midst of\n",
      "this great uninhabited country, made him so melancholy that he was just\n",
      "beginning to cry. But at that moment, at a short distance from the\n",
      "shore, he saw a big fish swimming by; it was going quietly on its own\n",
      "business with its head out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not knowing its name, the puppet called to it in a loud voice to make\n",
      "himself heard:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh, Sir Fish, will you permit me a word with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two if you like,\" answered the fish, who was a Dolphin, and so polite\n",
      "that few similar are to be found in any sea in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you be kind enough to tell me if there are villages in this island\n",
      "where it would be possible to obtain something to eat, without running\n",
      "the danger of being eaten?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly there are,\" replied the Dolphin. \"Indeed, you will find one\n",
      "at a short distance from here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what road must I take to go there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must take that path to your left and follow your nose. You cannot\n",
      "make a mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you tell me another thing? You who swim about the sea all day and\n",
      "all night, have you by chance met a little boat with my papa in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who is your papa?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is the best papa in the world, whilst it would be difficult to find\n",
      "a worse son than I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"During the terrible storm last night,\" answered the Dolphin, \"the\n",
      "little boat must have gone to the bottom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And my papa?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must have been swallowed by the terrible Dog-Fish, who for some days\n",
      "past has been spreading devastation and ruin in our waters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this Dog-Fish very big?\" asked Pinocchio, who was already beginning\n",
      "to quake with fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Big!\" replied the Dolphin. \"That you may form some idea of his size, I\n",
      "need only tell you that he is bigger than a five-storied house, and that\n",
      "his mouth is so enormous and so deep that a railway train with its\n",
      "smoking engine could pass down his throat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy upon us!\" exclaimed the terrified puppet; and, putting on his\n",
      "clothes with the greatest haste, he said to the Dolphin:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Sir Fish; excuse the trouble I have given you, and many\n",
      "thanks for your politeness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then took the path that had been pointed out to him and began to\n",
      "walk fast--so fast, indeed, that he was almost running. And at the\n",
      "slightest noise he turned to look behind him, fearing that he might see\n",
      "the terrible Dog-Fish with a railway train in its mouth following him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a walk of half an hour he reached a little village called \"The\n",
      "Village of the Industrious Bees.\" The road was alive with people running\n",
      "here and there to attend to their business; all were at work, all had\n",
      "something to do. You could not have found an idler or a vagabond, not\n",
      "even if you had searched for him with a lighted lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said that lazy Pinocchio at once, \"I see that this village will\n",
      "never suit me! I wasn't born to work!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile he was tormented by hunger, for he had eaten nothing\n",
      "for twenty-four hours--not even vetch. What was he to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were only two ways by which he could obtain food--either by asking\n",
      "for a little work, or by begging for a nickel or for a mouthful of\n",
      "bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was ashamed to beg, for his father had always preached to him that no\n",
      "one had a right to beg except the aged and the infirm. The really poor\n",
      "in this world, deserving of compassion and assistance, are only those\n",
      "who from age or sickness are no longer able to earn their own bread with\n",
      "the labor of their hands. It is the duty of every one else to work; and\n",
      "if they will not work, so much the worse for them if they suffer from\n",
      "hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment a man came down the road, tired and panting for breath.\n",
      "He was dragging, alone, with fatigue and difficulty, two carts full of\n",
      "charcoal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, judging by his face that he was a kind man, approached him\n",
      "and, casting down his eyes with shame, he said to him in a low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you have the charity to give me a nickel, for I am dying of\n",
      "hunger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall have not only a nickel,\" said the man, \"but I will give you a\n",
      "quarter, provided that you help me to drag home these two carts of\n",
      "charcoal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am surprised at you!\" answered the puppet in a tone of offense. \"Let\n",
      "me tell you that I am not accustomed to do the work of a donkey: I have\n",
      "never drawn a cart!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the better for you,\" answered the man. \"Then, my boy, if you\n",
      "are really dying of hunger, eat two fine slices of your pride, and be\n",
      "careful not to get indigestion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes afterwards a mason passed down the road carrying on his\n",
      "shoulders a basket of lime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you have the charity, good man, to give a nickel to a poor boy\n",
      "who is yawning for want of food?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willingly,\" answered the man. \"Come with me and carry the lime, and\n",
      "instead of a nickel I will give you a quarter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the lime is heavy,\" objected Pinocchio, \"and I don't want to tire\n",
      "myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you don't want to tire yourself, then, my boy, amuse yourself with\n",
      "yawning, and much good may it do you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than half an hour twenty other people went by, and Pinocchio\n",
      "asked charity of them all, but they all answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you not ashamed to beg? Instead of idling about the roads, go and\n",
      "look for a little work and learn to earn your bread.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At last a nice little woman carrying two cans of water came by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you let me drink a little water out of your can?\" asked Pinocchio,\n",
      "who was burning with thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drink, my boy, if you wish it!\" said the little woman, setting down the\n",

      "\n",
      "Pinocchio drank like a fish, and as he dried his mouth he mumbled:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have quenched my thirst. If I could only appease my hunger!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The good woman, hearing these words, said at once:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will help me to carry home these two cans of water I will give\n",
      "you a fine piece of bread.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio looked at the can and answered neither yes nor no.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And besides the bread you shall have a nice dish of cauliflower dressed\n",
      "with oil and vinegar,\" added the good woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio gave another look at the can and answered neither yes nor no.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And after the cauliflower I will give you a beautiful bonbon full of\n",
      "syrup.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The temptation of this last dainty was so great that Pinocchio could\n",
      "resist no longer and with an air of decision he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must have patience! I will carry the can to your house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The can was heavy and the puppet, not being strong enough to carry it in\n",
      "his hand, had to resign himself to carry it on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the house the good little woman made Pinocchio sit\n",
      "down at a small table already laid and she placed before him the bread,\n",
      "the cauliflower and the bonbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio did not eat, he devoured. His stomach was like an apartment\n",
      "that had been left empty and uninhabited for five months.\n",
      "\n",
      "When his ravenous hunger was somewhat appeased he raised his head to\n",
      "thank his benefactress, but he had no sooner looked at her than he gave\n",
      "a prolonged \"Oh-h!\" of astonishment and continued staring at her with\n",
      "wide open eyes, his fork in the air, and his mouth full of bread and\n",
      "cauliflower, as if he had been bewitched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has surprised you so much?\" asked the good woman, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is--\" answered the puppet, \"it is--it is--that you are like--that\n",
      "you remind me--yes, yes, yes, the same voice--the same eyes--the same\n",
      "hair--yes, yes, yes--you also have blue hair--as she had--Oh, little\n",
      "Fairy! tell me that it is you, really you! Do not make me cry any more!\n",
      "If you knew--I have cried so much, I have suffered so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, throwing himself at her feet on the floor, Pinocchio embraced the\n",
      "knees of the mysterious little woman and began to cry bitterly.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the good little woman maintained that she was not the little\n",
      "Fairy with blue hair, but, seeing that she was found out and not wishing\n",
      "to continue the comedy any longer, she ended by making herself known,\n",
      "and she said to Pinocchio:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You little rogue! how did you ever discover who I was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was my great affection for you that told me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you remember? You left me a child, and now that you have found me\n",
      "again I am a woman--a woman almost old enough to be your mamma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am delighted at that, for now, instead of calling you little sister,\n",
      "I will call you mamma. I have wished for such a long time to have a\n",
      "mamma like other boys! But how did you manage to grow so fast?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a secret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Teach it to me, for I should also like to grow. Don't you see? I always\n",
      "remain no bigger than a ninepin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you cannot grow,\" replied the Fairy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because puppets never grow. They are born puppets, live puppets, and\n",
      "die puppets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I am sick of being a puppet!\" cried Pinocchio, giving himself a\n",
      "slap. \"It is time that I became a man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you will become one, if you know how to deserve it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not really? And what can I do to deserve it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very easy thing: by learning to be a good boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you think I am not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite the contrary. Good boys are obedient, and you--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I never obey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good boys like to learn and to work, and you--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I instead lead an idle, vagabond life the year through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good boys always speak the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I always tell lies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good boys go willingly to school.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And school gives me pain all over the body. But from today I will\n",
      "change my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you promise me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise you. I will become a good little boy, and I will be the\n",
      "consolation of my papa. Where is my poor papa at this moment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I ever have the happiness of seeing him again and kissing him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so; indeed, I am sure of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this answer Pinocchio was so delighted that he took the Fairy's hands\n",
      "and began to kiss them with such fervor that he seemed beside himself.\n",
      "Then, raising his face and looking at her lovingly, he asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, little mamma: then it was not true that you were dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems not,\" said the Fairy, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you only knew the sorrow I felt and the tightening of my throat when\n",
      "I read, 'Here lies--'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it, and it is on that account that I have forgiven you. I saw\n",
      "from the sincerity of your grief that you had a good heart; and when\n",
      "boys have good hearts, even if they are scamps and have got bad habits,\n",
      "there is always something to hope for; that is, there is always hope\n",
      "that they will turn to better ways. That is why I came to look for you\n",
      "here. I will be your mamma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, how delightful!\" shouted Pinocchio, jumping for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must obey me and do everything that I bid you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willingly, willingly, willingly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tomorrow,\" rejoined the Fairy, \"you will begin to go to school.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio became at once a little less joyful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you must choose an art, or a trade, according to your own wishes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio became very grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you muttering between your teeth?\" asked the Fairy in an\n",
      "angry voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was saying,\" moaned the puppet in a low voice, \"that it seemed to me\n",
      "too late for me to go to school now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir. Keep it in mind that it is never too late to learn and to\n",
      "instruct ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I do not wish to follow either an art or a trade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it tires me to work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy,\" said the Fairy, \"those who talk in that way end almost always\n",
      "either in prison or in the hospital. Let me tell you that every man,\n",
      "whether he is born rich or poor, is obliged to do something in this\n",
      "world--to occupy himself, to work. Woe to those who lead slothful lives.\n",
      "Sloth is a dreadful illness and must be cured at once, in childhood. If\n",
      "not, when we are old it can never be cured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio was touched by these words and, lifting his head quickly, he\n",
      "said to the Fairy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will study, I will work, I will do all that you tell me, for indeed I\n",
      "have become weary of being a puppet, and I wish at any price to become a\n",
      "boy. You promised me that I should, did you not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did promise you, and it now depends upon yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day Pinocchio went to the government school. Imagine the\n",
      "delight of all the little rogues, when they saw a puppet walk into their\n",
      "school! They set up a roar of laughter that never ended. They played him\n",
      "all sorts of tricks. One boy carried off his cap, another pulled his\n",
      "jacket behind; one tried to give him a pair of inky mustachios just\n",
      "under his nose, and another attempted to tie strings to his feet and\n",
      "hands to make him dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a short time Pinocchio pretended not to care and got on as well as\n",
      "he could; but at last, losing all patience, he turned to those who were\n",
      "teasing him most and making game of him, and said to them, looking very\n",
      "angry:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beware, boys! I have not come here to be your buffoon. I respect\n",
      "others, and I intend to be respected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well said, boaster! You have spoken like a book!\" howled the young\n",
      "rascals, convulsed with mad laughter, and one of them, more impertinent\n",
      "than the others, stretched out his hand, intending to seize the puppet\n",
      "by the end of his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was not in time, for Pinocchio stuck his leg out from under the\n",
      "table and gave him a great kick on his shins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what hard feet!\" roared the boy, rubbing the bruise that the puppet\n",
      "had given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what elbows! even harder than his feet!\" said another, who for his\n",
      "rude tricks had received a blow in the stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, nevertheless, the kick and the blow acquired at once for Pinocchio\n",
      "the sympathy and the esteem of all the boys in the school. They all made\n",
      "friends with him and liked him heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even the master praised him, for he found him attentive, studious\n",
      "and intelligent--always the first to come to school, and the last to\n",
      "leave when school was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had one fault: he made too many friends, and amongst them were\n",
      "several young rascals well known for their dislike to study and love of\n",
      "mischief.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master warned him every day, and even the good Fairy never failed to\n",
      "tell him and to repeat constantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care, Pinocchio! Those bad school-fellows of yours will end sooner\n",
      "or later by making you lose all love of study, and perhaps they may even\n",
      "bring upon you some great misfortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no fear of that!\" answered the puppet, shrugging his shoulders\n",
      "and touching his forehead as much as to say: \"There is so much sense\n",
      "here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it happened that one fine day, as he was on his way to school, he\n",
      "met several of his usual companions who, coming up to him, asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you heard the great news?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the sea near here a Dog-Fish has appeared as big as a mountain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not really? Can it be the same Dog-Fish that was there when my papa was\n",
      "drowned?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are going to the shore to see him. Will you come with us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I am going to school.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What matters school? We can go to school tomorrow. Whether we have a\n",
      "lesson more or a lesson less, we shall always remain the same donkeys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what will the master say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The master may say what he likes. He is paid on purpose to grumble all\n",
      "day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And my mamma?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mammas know nothing,\" answered those bad little boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what I will do?\" said Pinocchio. \"I have reasons for\n",
      "wishing to see the Dog-Fish, but I will go and see him when school is\n",
      "over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor donkey!\" exclaimed one of the number. \"Do you suppose that a fish\n",
      "of that size will wait your convenience? As soon as he is tired of being\n",
      "here he will start for another place, and then it will be too late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long does it take to go from here to the shore?\" asked the puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can be there and back in an hour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then away!\" shouted Pinocchio, \"and he who runs fastest is the best!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thus given the signal to start, the boys, with their books and\n",
      "copy-books under their arms, rushed off across the fields, and Pinocchio\n",
      "was always the first--he seemed to have wings to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time he turned to jeer at his companions, who were some\n",
      "distance behind, and, seeing them panting for breath, covered with dust,\n",
      "and their tongues hanging out of their mouths, he laughed heartily. The\n",
      "unfortunate boy little knew what terrors and horrible disasters he was\n",
      "going to meet with!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he arrived on the shore Pinocchio looked out to sea, but he saw no\n",
      "Dog-Fish. The sea was as smooth as a great crystal mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the Dog-Fish?\" he asked, turning to his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must have gone to have his breakfast,\" said one of them, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or he has thrown himself on to his bed to have a little nap,\" added\n",
      "another, laughing still louder.\n",
      "\n",
      "From their absurd answers and silly laughter Pinocchio perceived that\n",
      "his companions had been making a fool of him, in inducing him to believe\n",
      "a tale with no truth in it. Taking it very badly, he said to them\n",
      "angrily:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, may I ask what fun you could find in deceiving me with the\n",
      "story of the Dog-Fish?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it was great fun!\" answered the little rascals in chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And in what did it consist?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In making you miss school and persuading you to come with us. Are you\n",
      "not ashamed of being always so punctual and so diligent with your\n",
      "lessons? Are you not ashamed of studying so hard?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if I study hard, what concern is it of yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It concerns us excessively, because it makes us appear in a bad light\n",
      "to the master.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because boys who study make those who, like us, have no wish to learn,\n",
      "seem worse by comparison. And that is too bad. We, too, have our pride!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what must I do to please you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must follow our example and hate school, lessons, and the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And if I wish to continue my studies?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case we will have nothing more to do with you, and at the first\n",
      "opportunity we will make you pay for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really,\" said the puppet, shaking his head, \"you make me inclined to\n",
      "laugh.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh, Pinocchio\" shouted the biggest of the boys, confronting him. \"None\n",
      "of your superior airs: don't come here to crow over us, for if you are\n",
      "not afraid of us, we are not afraid of you. Remember that you are one\n",
      "against seven of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven, like the seven deadly sins,\" said Pinocchio, with a shout of\n",
      "laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen to him! He has insulted us all! He called us the seven deadly\n",

      "of the boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, so saying, he gave him a blow on the head with his fist.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was give and take; for the puppet, as was to be expected,\n",
      "immediately returned the blow, and the fight in a moment became general\n",
      "and desperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, although he was one alone, defended himself like a hero. He\n",
      "used his feet, which were of the hardest wood, to such purpose that he\n",
      "kept his enemies at a respectful distance. Wherever they touched they\n",
      "left a bruise by way of reminder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boys, becoming furious at not being able to measure themselves hand\n",
      "to hand with the puppet, had recourse to other weapons. Loosening their\n",
      "satchels, they commenced throwing their school-books at him--grammars,\n",
      "dictionaries, spelling-books, geography books, and other scholastic\n",
      "works. But Pinocchio was quick and had sharp eyes, and always managed to\n",
      "duck in time, so that the books passed over his head and all fell into\n",
      "the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine the astonishment of the fish! Thinking that the books were\n",
      "something to eat they all arrived in shoals, but, having tasted a page\n",
      "or two, or a frontispiece, they spat it quickly out and made a wry face\n",
      "that seemed to say: \"It isn't food for us; we are accustomed to\n",
      "something much better!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle meantime had become fiercer than ever, when a big crab, who\n",
      "had come out of the water and had climbed slowly up on the shore, called\n",
      "out in a hoarse voice that sounded like a trumpet with a bad cold:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FOUR RABBITS AS BLACK AS INK ENTERED CARRYING A LITTLE\n",

      "Poor crab! He might as well have preached to the wind. Even that young\n",

      "possession of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the books there was one bound in strong cardboard with the back\n",

      "One of the boys seized this volume and, aiming at Pinocchio's head,\n",

      "turning as white as a sheet, said only:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, mother! help, I am dying!\" and fell his whole length on the sand.\n",
      "Thinking he was dead, the terrified boys ran off as hard as their legs\n",
      "could carry them and in a few minutes they were out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Pinocchio remained. Although from grief and fright he was more dead\n",
      "than alive, nevertheless he ran and soaked his handkerchief in the sea\n",
      "and began to bathe the temples of his poor school-fellow. Crying\n",
      "bitterly in his despair, he kept calling him by name and saying to him:\n",

      "become of me? Where can I fly to? Oh! how much better it would have\n",
      "been, a thousand times better, if I had only gone to school! Why did I\n",
      "listen to my companions? they have been my ruin. The master said to me,\n",
      "and my mamma repeated it often: 'Beware of bad companions!' Oh, dear!\n",
      "what will become of me, what will become of me, what will become of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio began to cry and sob, and to strike his head with his\n",
      "fists, and to call poor Eugene by his name. Suddenly he heard the sound\n",
      "of approaching footsteps.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and saw two soldiers.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If it was not you, who then did it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I,\" repeated Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And with what was he wounded?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With this book.\" And the puppet picked up from the ground the Treatise\n",
      "on Arithmetic, bound in cardboard and parchment, and showed it to the\n",
      "soldier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And to whom does this belong?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To me.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Come along with us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before they left, the soldiers called some fishermen who were passing at\n",
      "that moment near the shore in their boat, and said to them:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We give this boy who has been wounded in the head in your charge. Carry\n",
      "him to your house and nurse him. Tomorrow we will come and see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They then turned to Pinocchio and, having placed him between them, they\n",

      "\"Forward! and walk quickly, or it will be the worse for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without requiring it to be repeated, the puppet set out along the road\n",
      "leading to the village. But the poor little devil hardly knew where he\n",
      "was. He thought he must be dreaming, and what a dreadful dream! He was\n",
      "beside himself. He saw double; his legs shook; his tongue clung to the\n",
      "roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a word. And yet, in the midst\n",
      "of his stupefaction and apathy, his heart was pierced by a cruel\n",
      "thorn--the thought that he would pass under the windows of the good\n",
      "Fairy's house between the soldiers. He would rather have died.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had already reached the village when a gust of wind blew\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go, then; but be quick about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet went and picked up his cap, but instead of putting it on his\n",
      "head he took it between his teeth and began to run as hard as he could\n",
      "towards the seashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldiers, thinking it would be difficult to overtake him, sent after\n",
      "him a large mastiff who had won the first prizes at all the dog races.\n",
      "Pinocchio ran, but the dog ran faster. The people came to their windows\n",
      "and crowded into the street in their anxiety to see the end of the\n",
      "desperate race.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There came a moment in this desperate race--a terrible moment--when\n",
      "Pinocchio thought himself lost: for Alidoro, the mastiff, had run so\n",
      "swiftly that he had nearly come up with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet could hear the panting of the dreadful beast close behind\n",
      "him; there was not a hand's breadth between them, he could even feel the\n",
      "dog's hot breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately the shore was close and the sea but a few steps off.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he reached the sands the puppet made a wonderful leap--a frog\n",
      "could have done no better--and plunged into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alidoro, on the contrary, wished to stop himself, but, carried away by\n",
      "the impetus of the race, he also went into the sea. The unfortunate dog\n",
      "could not swim, but he made great efforts to keep himself afloat with\n",
      "his paws; but the more he struggled the farther he sank head downwards\n",
      "under the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he rose to the surface again his eyes were rolling with terror, and\n",
      "he barked out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am drowning! I am drowning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drown!\" shouted Pinocchio from a distance, seeing himself safe from all\n",
      "danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help me, dear Pinocchio! Save me from death!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that agonizing cry the puppet, who had in reality an excellent heart,\n",
      "was moved with compassion, and, turning to the dog, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if I save your life, will you promise to give me no further\n",
      "annoyance, and not to run after me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise! I promise! Be quick, for pity's sake, for if you delay\n",
      "another half-minute I shall be dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio hesitated; but, remembering that his father had often told him\n",
      "that a good action is never lost, he swam to Alidoro, and, taking hold\n",
      "of his tail with both hands, brought him safe and sound on to the dry\n",
      "sand of the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor dog could not stand. He had drunk so much salt water that he\n",
      "was like a balloon. The puppet, however, not wishing to trust him too\n",
      "far, thought it more prudent to jump again into the water. When he had\n",
      "swum some distance from the shore he called out to the friend he had\n",
      "rescued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Alidoro; a good journey to you, and take my compliments to\n",
      "all at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Pinocchio,\" answered the dog; \"a thousand thanks for having\n",
      "saved my life. You have done me a great service, and in this world what\n",
      "is given is returned. If an occasion offers I shall not forget it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio swam on, keeping always near the land. At last he thought that\n",
      "he had reached a safe place. Giving a look along the shore, he saw\n",
      "amongst the rocks a kind of cave from which a cloud of smoke was\n",
      "ascending.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that cave,\" he said to himself, \"there must be a fire. So much the\n",
      "better. I will go and dry and warm myself, and then? and then we shall\n",
      "see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having taken the resolution he approached the rocks, but, as he was\n",
      "going to climb up, he felt something under the water that rose higher\n",
      "and higher and carried him into the air. He tried to escape, but it was\n",
      "too late, for, to his extreme surprise, he found himself enclosed in a\n",
      "great net, together with a swarm of fish of every size and shape, who\n",
      "were flapping and struggling like so many despairing souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment a fisherman came out of the cave; he was so ugly, so\n",
      "horribly ugly, that he looked like a sea monster. Instead of hair his\n",
      "head was covered with a thick bush of green grass, his skin was green,\n",
      "his eyes were green, his long beard that came down to the ground was\n",
      "also green. He had the appearance of an immense lizard standing on its\n",
      "hind-paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the fisherman had drawn his net out of the sea, he exclaimed with\n",
      "great satisfaction:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank Heaven! Again today I shall have a splendid feast of fish!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a mercy that I am not a fish!\" said Pinocchio to himself,\n",
      "regaining a little courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The netful of fish was carried into the cave, which was dark and smoky.\n",
      "In the middle of the cave a large frying-pan full of oil was frying and\n",
      "sending out a smell of mushrooms that was suffocating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we will see what fish we have taken!\" said the green fisherman,\n",
      "and, putting into the net an enormous hand, so out of all proportion\n",
      "that it looked like a baker's shovel, he pulled out a handful of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These fish are good!\" he said, looking at them and smelling them\n",
      "complacently. And after he had smelled them he threw them into a pan\n",
      "without water.\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated the same operation many times, and as he drew out the fish\n",
      "his mouth watered and he said, chuckling to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What good whiting!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What exquisite sardines!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These soles are delicious!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And these crabs excellent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What dear little anchovies!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The last to remain in the net was Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had the fisherman taken him out than he opened his big green\n",
      "eyes with astonishment and cried, half frightened:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What species of fish is this? Fish of this kind I never remember to\n",
      "have eaten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he looked at him again attentively and, having examined him well all\n",
      "over, he ended by saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know: he must be a craw-fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, mortified at being mistaken for a craw-fish, said in an angry\n",
      "voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A craw-fish indeed! Do you take me for a craw-fish? what treatment! Let\n",
      "me tell you that I am a puppet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A puppet?\" replied the fisherman. \"To tell the truth, a puppet is\n",
      "quite a new fish for me. All the better! I shall eat you with greater\n",
      "pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eat me! but will you understand that I am not a fish? Do you hear that\n",
      "I talk and reason as you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is quite true,\" said the fisherman; \"and as I see that you are a\n",
      "fish possessed of the talent of talking and reasoning as I do, I will\n",
      "treat you with all the attention that is your due.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And this attention?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In token of my friendship and particular regard, I will leave you the\n",
      "choice of how you would like to be cooked. Would you like to be fried in\n",
      "the frying-pan, or would you prefer to be stewed with tomato sauce?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To tell the truth,\" answered Pinocchio, \"if I am to choose, I should\n",
      "prefer to be set at liberty and to return home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are joking! Do you imagine that I would lose the opportunity of\n",
      "tasting such a rare fish? It is not every day, I assure you, that a\n",
      "puppet fish is caught in these waters. Leave it to me. I will fry you in\n",
      "the frying-pan with the other fish, and you will be quite satisfied. It\n",
      "is always consolation to be fried in company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this speech the unhappy Pinocchio began to cry and scream and to\n",
      "implore for mercy, and he said, sobbing: \"How much better it would have\n",
      "been if I had gone to school! I would listen to my companions and now I\n",
      "am paying for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he wriggled like an eel and made indescribable efforts to slip out\n",
      "of the clutches of the green fisherman. But it was useless: the\n",
      "fisherman took a long strip of rush and, having bound his hands and feet\n",
      "as if he had been a sausage, he threw him into the pan with the other\n",
      "fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then fetched a wooden bowl full of flour and began to flour them\n",
      "each in turn, and as soon as they were ready he threw them into the\n",
      "frying-pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to dance in the boiling oil were the poor whitings; the crabs\n",
      "followed, then the sardines, then the soles, then the anchovies, and at\n",
      "last it was Pinocchio's turn. Seeing himself so near death, and such a\n",
      "horrible death, he was so frightened, and trembled so violently, that he\n",
      "had neither voice nor breath left for further entreaties.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the poor boy implored with his eyes! The green fisherman, however,\n",
      "without caring in the least, plunged him five or six times in the flour,\n",
      "until he was white from head to foot and looked like a puppet made of\n",
      "plaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the fisherman was on the point of throwing Pinocchio into the\n",
      "frying-pan a large dog entered the cave, enticed there by the strong and\n",
      "savory odor of fried fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get out!\" shouted the fisherman, threateningly, holding the floured\n",
      "puppet in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the poor dog, who was as hungry as a wolf, whined and wagged his\n",
      "tail as much as to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a mouthful of fish and I will leave you in peace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get out, I tell you!\" repeated the fisherman and he stretched out his\n",
      "leg to give him a kick.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the dog, who, when he was really hungry, would not stand trifling,\n",
      "turned upon him, growling and showing his terrible tusks.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment a little feeble voice was heard in the cave, saying\n",
      "entreatingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Save me, Alidoro! If you do not save me I shall be fried!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog recognized Pinocchio's voice and, to his extreme surprise,\n",
      "perceived that it proceeded from the floured bundle that the fisherman\n",
      "held in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what do you think he did? He made a spring, seized the bundle in his\n",
      "mouth, and, holding it gently between his teeth, he rushed out of the\n",
      "cave and was gone like a flash of lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fisherman, furious at seeing a fish he was so anxious to eat\n",
      "snatched from him, ran after the dog, but he had not gone many steps\n",
      "when he was taken with a fit of coughing and had to give it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alidoro, when he had reached the path that led to the village, stopped\n",
      "and put his friend Pinocchio gently on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much I have to thank you for!\" said the puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no necessity,\" replied the dog. \"You saved me and I have now\n",
      "returned it. You know that we must all help each other in this world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how came you to come to the cave?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was lying on the shore more dead than alive when the wind brought to\n",
      "me the smell of fried fish. The smell excited my appetite and I followed\n",
      "it up. If I had arrived a second later--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not mention it!\" groaned Pinocchio, who was still trembling with\n",
      "fright. \"Do not mention it! If you had arrived a second later I should\n",
      "by this time have been fried, eaten and digested. Brrr! It makes me\n",
      "shudder only to think of it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alidoro, laughing, extended his right paw to the puppet, who shook it\n",
      "heartily in token of great friendship, and they then separated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog took the road home, and Pinocchio, left alone, went to a cottage\n",
      "not far off and said to a little old man who was warming himself in the\n",
      "sun:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, good man, do you know anything of a poor boy called Eugene who\n",
      "was wounded in the head?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The boy was brought by some fishermen to this cottage, and now--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now he is dead!\" interrupted Pinocchio with great sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he is alive and has returned to his home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not really? not really?\" cried the puppet, dancing with delight. \"Then\n",
      "the wound was not serious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It might have been very serious and even fatal,\" answered the little\n",
      "old man, \"for they threw a thick book bound in cardboard at his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who threw it at him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of his school-fellows, a certain Pinocchio.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who is this Pinocchio?\" asked the puppet, pretending ignorance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They say that he is a bad boy, a vagabond, a regular good-for-nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Calumnies! all calumnies!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know this Pinocchio?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By sight!\" answered the puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what is your opinion of him?\" asked the little man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He seems to me to be a very good boy, anxious to learn, and obedient\n",
      "and affectionate to his father and family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst the puppet was firing off all these lies, he touched his nose and\n",
      "perceived that it had lengthened more than a hand. Very much alarmed he\n",
      "began to cry out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't believe, good man, what I have been telling you. I know Pinocchio\n",
      "very well and I can assure you that he is a very bad boy, disobedient\n",
      "and idle, who, instead of going to school, runs off with his companions\n",
      "to amuse himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hardly finished speaking when his nose became shorter and\n",
      "returned to the same size that it was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why are you all covered with white?\" asked the old man suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you. Without observing it I rubbed myself against a wall\n",
      "which had been freshly whitewashed,\" answered the puppet, ashamed to\n",
      "confess that he had been floured like a fish prepared for the\n",
      "frying-pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what have you done with your jacket, your trousers, and your cap?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "you perhaps give me some clothes to return home in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy, as to clothes, I have nothing but a little sack in which I keep\n",
      "beans. If you wish for it, take it; there it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio did not wait to be told twice. He took the sack at once and\n",
      "with a pair of scissors he cut a hole at the end and at each side, and\n",
      "put it on like a shirt. And with this slight clothing he set off for the\n",
      "village.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he went he did not feel at all comfortable--so little so, indeed,\n",
      "that for a step forward he took another backwards, and he said, talking\n",
      "to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How shall I ever present myself to my good little Fairy? What will she\n",
      "say when she sees me? Will she forgive me this second escapade? Oh, I am\n",

      "rascal. I am always promising to correct myself and I never keep my\n",
      "word!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the village it was night and very dark. A storm had come\n",

      "\n",
      "But when he was there his courage failed him and instead of knocking he\n",
      "ran away some twenty paces. He returned to the door a second time and\n",
      "laid hold of the knocker, and, trembling, gave a little knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited and waited. At last, after half an hour had passed, a window\n",
      "on the top floor was opened--the house was four stories high--and\n",
      "Pinocchio saw a big Snail with a lighted candle on her head looking out.\n",
      "She called to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is there at this hour?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Pinocchio.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who is Pinocchio?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The puppet who lives in the Fairy's house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, I understand!\" said the Snail. \"Wait for me there. I will come down\n",
      "and open the door directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be quick, for pity's sake, for I am dying of cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy, I am a snail, and snails are never in a hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour passed, and then two, and the door was not opened. Pinocchio,\n",
      "who was wet through and through, and trembling from cold and fear, at\n",
      "last took courage and knocked again, and this time he knocked louder.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this second knock a window on the lower story opened and the same\n",
      "Snail appeared at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beautiful little Snail,\" cried Pinocchio from the street, \"I have been\n",
      "waiting for two hours! And two hours on such a bad night seem longer\n",
      "than two years. Be quick, for pity's sake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy,\" answered the calm little animal--\"my boy, I am a snail, and\n",
      "snails are never in a hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the window was shut again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly afterwards midnight struck; then one o'clock, then two o'clock,\n",
      "and the door remained still closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio at last, losing all patience, seized the knocker in a rage,\n",
      "intending to give a blow that would resound through the house. But the\n",
      "knocker, which was iron, turned suddenly into an eel and, slipping out\n",
      "of his hands, disappeared in the stream of water that ran down the\n",
      "middle of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! is that it?\" shouted Pinocchio, blind with rage. \"Since the knocker\n",
      "has disappeared, I will kick instead with all my might.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, drawing a little back, he gave a tremendous kick against the house\n",
      "door. The blow was indeed so violent that his foot went through the wood\n",
      "and stuck; and when he tried to draw it back again it was trouble thrown\n",
      "away, for it remained fixed like a nail that has been hammered down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of poor Pinocchio! He was obliged to spend the remainder of the\n",
      "night with one foot on the ground and the other in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following morning at daybreak the door was at last opened. The\n",
      "clever little Snail had taken only nine hours to come down from the\n",
      "fourth story to the house-door. It is evident that her exertions must\n",
      "have been great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing with your foot stuck in the door?\" she asked the\n",
      "puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was an accident. Do try, beautiful little Snail, if you cannot\n",
      "release me from this torture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy, that is the work of a carpenter, and I have never been a\n",
      "carpenter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beg the Fairy from me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Fairy is asleep and must not be awakened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what do you suppose that I can do all day nailed to this door?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amuse yourself by counting the ants that pass down the street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring me at least something to eat, for I am quite exhausted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At once,\" said the Snail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, after three hours and a half she returned to Pinocchio carrying\n",
      "a silver tray on her head. The tray contained a loaf of bread, a roast\n",
      "chicken, and four ripe apricots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is the breakfast that the Fairy has sent you,\" said the Snail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet felt very much comforted at the sight of these good things.\n",
      "But when he began to eat them, what was his disgust at making the\n",
      "discovery that the bread was plaster, the chicken cardboard, and the\n",
      "four apricots painted alabaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to cry. In his desperation he tried to throw away the tray and\n",
      "all that was on it; but instead, either from grief or exhaustion, he\n",
      "fainted away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to himself he found that he was lying on a sofa, and the\n",
      "Fairy was beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will pardon you once more,\" the Fairy said, \"but woe to you if you\n",
      "behave badly a third time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio promised and swore that he would study, and that for the\n",
      "future he would always conduct himself well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he kept his word for the remainder of the year. Indeed, at the\n",
      "examinations before the holidays, he had the honor of being the first in\n",
      "the school, and his behavior in general was so satisfactory and\n",
      "praiseworthy that the Fairy was very much pleased, and said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tomorrow your wish shall be gratified.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tomorrow you shall cease to be a wooden puppet and you shall become a\n",
      "boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one who had not witnessed it could ever imagine Pinocchio's joy at\n",
      "this long-sighed-for good fortune. All his school-fellows were to be\n",
      "invited for the following day to a grand breakfast at the Fairy's house,\n",
      "that they might celebrate together the great event. The Fairy had\n",
      "prepared two hundred cups of coffee and milk, and four hundred rolls cut\n",
      "and buttered on each side. The day promised to be most happy and\n",
      "delightful, but--\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately in the lives of puppets there is always a \"but\" that\n",
      "spoils everything.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, as was natural, asked the Fairy's permission to go round the\n",
      "town to give out the invitations, and the Fairy said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go, if you like, and invite your companions for the breakfast tomorrow,\n",
      "but remember to return home before dark. Have you understood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise to be back in an hour,\" answered the puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care, Pinocchio! Boys are always very ready to promise, but\n",
      "generally they are little given to keep their word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am not like other boys. When I say a thing, I do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall see. If you are disobedient, so much the worse for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because boys who do not listen to the advice of those who know more\n",

      "mistake again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall see if that is true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without saying more the puppet took leave of his good Fairy, who was\n",
      "like a mamma to him, and went out of the house singing and dancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than an hour all his friends were invited. Some accepted at once\n",
      "heartily; others at first required pressing; but when they heard that\n",
      "the rolls to be eaten with the coffee were to be buttered on both sides\n",
      "they ended by saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will come also, to do you a pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I must tell you that amongst Pinocchio's friends and school-fellows\n",
      "there was one that he greatly preferred and was very fond of. This boy's\n",
      "name was Romeo, but he always went by the nickname of Candlewick,\n",
      "because he was so thin, straight and bright, like the new wick of a\n",
      "little nightlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Candlewick was the laziest and the naughtiest boy in the school, but\n",
      "Pinocchio was devoted to him. He had indeed gone at once to his house to\n",
      "invite him to the breakfast, but he had not found him. He returned a\n",
      "second time, but Candlewick was not there. He went a third time, but it\n",
      "was in vain. Where could he search for him? He looked here, there, and\n",
      "everywhere, and at last he saw him hiding on the porch of a peasant's\n",
      "cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing there?\" asked Pinocchio, coming up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am waiting for midnight, to start away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And where are you going?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to live in a country--the most delightful country in the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And what is it called?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is called the 'Land of Boobies.' Why do you not come, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I? No, never!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are wrong, Pinocchio. If you do not come you will repent it. Where\n",
      "could you find a better country for us boys? There are no schools there;\n",
      "there are no masters; there are no books. In that delightful land nobody\n",
      "ever studies. On Saturday there is never school, and every week consists\n",
      "of six Saturdays and one Sunday. Only think, the autumn holidays begin\n",
      "on the first of January and finish on the last day of December. That is\n",
      "the country for me! That is what all civilized countries should be\n",
      "like!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how are the days spent in the 'Land of Boobies'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They are spent in play and amusement from morning till night. When night\n",
      "comes you go to bed, and recommence the same life in the morning. What\n",
      "do you think of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum!\" said Pinocchio, and he shook his head slightly, as much as to\n",
      "say, \"That is a life that I also would willingly lead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, will you go with me? Yes or no? Resolve quickly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no, and again no. I promised my good Fairy to become a well\n",
      "conducted boy, and I will keep my word. And as I see that the sun is\n",
      "setting I must leave you at once and run away. Good-bye, and a pleasant\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Where are you rushing off to in such a hurry?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It will make me too late.\"\n",

      "\"And if the Fairy scolds me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let her scold. When she has scolded well she will hold her tongue,\"\n",
      "said that rascal Candlewick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what are you going to do? Are you going alone or with companions?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alone? Indeed not, there will be more than a hundred boys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you make the journey on foot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A coach will pass by shortly which is to take me to that happy\n",
      "country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would I not give for the coach to pass by now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I might see you all start together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay here a little longer and you will see us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, I must go home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait another two minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have already delayed too long. The Fairy will be anxious about me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Fairy! Is she afraid that the bats will eat you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But now,\" continued Pinocchio, \"are you really certain that there are\n",
      "no schools in that country?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not even the shadow of one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And no masters either?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And no one is ever made to study?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, never, never!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a delightful country!\" said Pinocchio, his mouth watering. \"What a\n",
      "delightful country! I have never been there, but I can quite imagine\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why will you not come also?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is useless to tempt me. I promised my good Fairy to become a\n",
      "sensible boy, and I will not break my word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, then, and give my compliments to all the boys at school, if\n",
      "you meet them in the street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Candlewick; a pleasant journey to you; amuse yourself, and\n",
      "think sometimes of your friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus saying, the puppet made two steps to go, but then stopped, and,\n",
      "turning to his friend, he inquired:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But are you quite certain that in that country all the weeks consist of\n",
      "six Saturdays and one Sunday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most certainly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But do you know for certain that the holidays begin on the first of\n",
      "January and finish on the last day of December?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Assuredly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a delightful country!\" repeated Pinocchio, looking enchanted.\n",
      "Then, with a resolute air, he added in a great hurry:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This time really good-bye, and a pleasant journey to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When do you start?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shortly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a pity! If really it wanted only an hour to the time of your\n",
      "start, I should almost be tempted to wait.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Fairy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is already late. If I return home an hour sooner or later it will\n",
      "be all the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Pinocchio! And if the Fairy scolds you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must have patience! I will let her scold. When she has scolded well\n",
      "she will hold her tongue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime night had come on and it was quite dark. Suddenly they\n",
      "saw in the distance a small light moving and they heard a noise of\n",
      "talking, and the sound of a trumpet, but so small and feeble that it\n",
      "resembled the hum of a mosquito.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here it is!\" shouted Candlewick, jumping to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" asked Pinocchio in a whisper.\n",

      "\n",
      "The coach was, in fact, quite full of boys between eight and fourteen\n",

      "uncomfortable, packed closely together and could hardly breathe; but\n",
      "nobody said \"Oh!\"--nobody grumbled. The consolation of knowing that in a\n",
      "few hours they would reach a country where there were no books, no\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I will go on foot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, I could not allow that. I would rather mount one of these\n",
      "donkeys,\" cried Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaching the right-hand donkey of the first pair, he attempted to\n",
      "mount him, but the animal turned on him and, giving him a great blow in\n",
      "the stomach, rolled him over with his legs in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can imagine the impertinent and immoderate laughter of all the boys\n",
      "who witnessed this scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little man did not laugh. He approached the rebellious donkey\n",
      "and, pretending to give him a kiss, bit off half of his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio in the meantime had gotten up from the ground in a fury and,\n",
      "with a spring, he seated himself on the poor animal's back. And he\n",
      "sprang so well that the boys stopped laughing and began to shout:\n",
      "\"Hurrah, Pinocchio!\" and they clapped their hands and applauded him as\n",
      "if they would never finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that Pinocchio was mounted, the coach started. Whilst the donkeys\n",
      "were galloping and the coach was rattling over the stones of the high\n",
      "road, the puppet thought that he heard a low voice that was scarcely\n",
      "audible saying to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor fool! you would follow your own way, but you will repent it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, feeling almost frightened, looked from side to side to try\n",
      "and discover where these words could come from, but he saw nobody. The\n",
      "donkeys galloped, the coach rattled, the boys inside slept, Candlewick\n",
      "snored like a dormouse, and the little man seated on the box sang\n",
      "between his teeth:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"During the night all sleep,\n",
      "        But I sleep never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had gone another mile, Pinocchio heard the same little low\n",
      "voice saying to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bear it in mind, simpleton! Boys who refuse to study and turn their\n",
      "backs upon books, schools and masters, to pass their time in play and\n",
      "amusement, sooner or later come to a bad end. I know it by experience,\n",
      "and I can tell you. A day will come when you will weep as I am weeping\n",
      "now, but then it will be too late!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these words whispered very softly, the puppet, more\n",
      "frightened than ever, sprang down from the back of his donkey and went\n",
      "and took hold of his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine his surprise when he found that the donkey was crying--crying\n",
      "like a boy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh! Sir Coachman,\" cried Pinocchio to the little man, \"here is an\n",
      "extraordinary thing! This donkey is crying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let him cry; he will laugh when he is a bridegroom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But have you by chance taught him to talk?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but he spent three years in a company of learned dogs, and he\n",
      "learned to mutter a few words.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor beast!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come,\" said the little man, \"don't let us waste time in seeing a\n",

      "is long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio obeyed without another word. In the morning about daybreak\n",
      "they arrived safely in the \"Land of Boobies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a country unlike any other country in the world. The population\n",
      "was composed entirely of boys. The oldest were fourteen, and the\n",
      "youngest scarcely eight years old. In the streets there was such\n",
      "merriment, noise and shouting that it was enough to turn anybody's head.\n",
      "There were troops of boys everywhere. Some were playing with nuts, some\n",
      "with battledores, some with balls. Some rode velocipedes, others wooden\n",
      "horses. A party were playing at hide and seek, a few were chasing each\n",
      "other. Some were reciting, some singing, some leaping. Some were amusing\n",
      "themselves with walking on their hands with their feet in the air;\n",
      "others were trundling hoops or strutting about dressed as generals,\n",
      "wearing leaf helmets and commanding a squadron of cardboard soldiers.\n",
      "Some were laughing, some shouting, some were calling out; others clapped\n",
      "their hands, or whistled, or clucked like a hen who has just laid an\n",
      "egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every square, canvas theaters had been erected and they were crowded\n",
      "with boys from morning till evening. On the walls of the houses there\n",
      "were inscriptions written in charcoal: \"Long live playthings, we will\n",
      "have no more schools; down with arithmetic,\" and similar other fine\n",
      "sentiments, all in bad spelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, Candlewick and the other boys who had made the journey with\n",
      "the little man, had scarcely set foot in the town before they were in\n",
      "the thick of the tumult, and I need not tell you that in a few minutes\n",
      "they had made acquaintance with everybody. Where could happier or more\n",
      "contented boys be found?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of continual games and every variety of amusement, the\n",
      "hours, the days and the weeks passed like lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what a delightful life!\" said Pinocchio, whenever by chance he met\n",
      "Candlewick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See, then, if I was not right?\" replied the other. \"And to think that\n",
      "you did not want to come! To think that you had taken it into your head\n",
      "to return home to your Fairy, and to lose your time in studying! If you\n",
      "are this moment free from the bother of books and school, you must\n",
      "acknowledge that you owe it to me, to my advice, and to my persuasions.\n",
      "It is only friends who know how to render such great services.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true, Candlewick! If I am now a really happy boy, it is all your\n",
      "doing. But do you know what the master used to say when he talked to me\n",
      "of you? He always said to me: 'Do not associate with that rascal\n",
      "Candlewick, for he is a bad companion, and will only lead you into\n",
      "mischief!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor master!\" replied the other, shaking his head. \"I know only too\n",
      "well that he disliked me, and amused himself by calumniating me; but I\n",
      "am generous and I forgive him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Noble soul!\" said Pinocchio, embracing his friend affectionately and\n",
      "kissing him between the eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This delightful life had gone on for five months. The days had been\n",
      "entirely spent in play and amusement, without a thought of books or\n",

      "in scratching his head he discovered, to his great astonishment, that\n",
      "his ears had grown more than a hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know that the puppet from his birth had always had very small\n",
      "ears--so small that they were not visible to the naked eye. You can\n",
      "imagine then what he felt when he found that during the night his ears\n",
      "had become so long that they seemed like two brooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went at once in search of a glass that he might look at himself, but,\n",
      "not being able to find one, he filled the basin of his washing-stand\n",
      "with water, and he saw reflected what he certainly would never have\n",
      "wished to see. He saw his head embellished with a magnificent pair of\n",
      "donkey's ears!\n",
      "\n",
      "Only think of poor Pinocchio's sorrow, shame and despair!\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to cry and roar, and he beat his head against the wall, but the\n",
      "more he cried the longer his ears grew; they grew, and grew, and became\n",
      "hairy towards the points.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sound of his loud outcries a beautiful little Marmot that lived\n",
      "on the first floor came into the room. Seeing the puppet in such grief\n",
      "she asked earnestly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has happened to you, my dear fellow-lodger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am ill, my dear little Marmot, very ill, and my illness frightens me.\n",

      "\"A little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then feel and see if by chance I have got fever.\"\n",

      "\"My friend, I am grieved to be obliged to give you bad news!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\"\n",

      "\"What fever is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is donkey fever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a fever that I do not understand,\" said the puppet, but he\n",
      "understood it only too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I will explain it to you,\" said the Marmot. \"You must know that in\n",
      "two or three hours you will be no longer a puppet, or a boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what shall I be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In two or three hours you will become really and truly a little donkey,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, unfortunate that I am! unfortunate that I am!\" cried Pinocchio,\n",
      "seizing his two ears with his hands and pulling them and tearing them\n",
      "furiously as if they had been some one else's ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear boy,\" said the Marmot, by way of consoling him, \"you can do\n",

      "boys who are lazy, and who take a dislike to books, to schools, and to\n",
      "masters, and who pass their time in amusement, games, and diversions,\n",
      "must end sooner or later by becoming transformed into so many little\n",
      "donkeys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But is it really so?\" asked the puppet, sobbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is indeed only too true! And tears are now useless. You should have\n",
      "thought of it sooner!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it was not my fault; believe me, little Marmot, the fault was all\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And who is this Candlewick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of my school-fellows. I wanted to return home; I wanted to be\n",
      "obedient. I wished to study, but Candlewick said to me: 'Why should you\n",
      "bother yourself by studying? Why should you go to school? Come with us\n",
      "instead to the \"Land of Boobies\"; there we shall none of us have to\n",
      "learn; there we shall amuse ourselves from morning to night, and we\n",
      "shall always be merry'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why did you follow the advice of that false friend? of that bad\n",
      "companion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why? Because, my dear little Marmot, I am a puppet with no sense, and\n",
      "with no heart. Ah! if I had had the least heart I should never have left\n",
      "that good Fairy who loved me like a mamma, and who had done so much for\n",
      "me! And I would be no longer a puppet, for I would by this time have\n",
      "become a little boy like so many others: But if I meet Candlewick, woe\n",
      "to him! He shall hear what I think of him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he turned to go out. But when he reached the door he remembered his\n",
      "donkey's ears, and, feeling ashamed to show them in public, what do you\n",
      "think he did? He took a big cotton cap and, putting it on his head, he\n",
      "pulled it well down over the point of his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then set out and went everywhere in search of Candlewick. He looked\n",
      "for him in the streets, in the squares, in the little theaters, in every\n",
      "possible place, but he could not find him. He inquired for him of\n",
      "everybody he met, but no one had seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went to seek him at his house and, having reached the door, he\n",

      "\"Wait a moment and I will let you in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After half an hour the door was opened and imagine Pinocchio's feelings\n",
      "when, upon going into the room, he saw his friend Candlewick with a big\n",
      "cotton cap on his head which came down over his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sight of the cap Pinocchio felt almost consoled and thought to\n",
      "himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has my friend got the same illness that I have? Is he also suffering\n",
      "from donkey fever?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, pretending to have observed nothing, he asked him, smiling:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you, my dear Candlewick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; as well as a mouse in a Parmesan cheese.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you saying that seriously?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should I tell you a lie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me; but why, then, do you keep that cotton cap on your head\n",
      "which covers up your ears?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The doctor ordered me to wear it because I have hurt this knee. And\n",

      "\"Oh, poor Candlewick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After these words a long silence followed, during which the two friends\n",
      "did nothing but look mockingly at each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the puppet said in a soft voice to his companion:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Satisfy my curiosity, my dear Candlewick: have you ever suffered from\n",
      "disease of the ears?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never! And you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never. Only since this morning one of my ears aches.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine is also paining me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You also? And which of your ears hurts you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both of them. And you?\"\n",

      "\"I fear so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you do me a kindness, Candlewick?\"\n",

      "\"Willingly! With all my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you let me see your ears?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not? But first, my dear Pinocchio, I should like to see yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No: you must be first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear. First you and then I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the puppet, \"let us come to an agreement like good\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Let us hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will both take off our caps at the same moment. Do you agree?\"\n",

      "\"I agree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, attention!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio began to count in a loud voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One, two, three!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the word \"Three!\" the two boys took off their caps and threw them\n",
      "into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then a scene followed that would seem incredible if it were not\n",
      "true. That is, that when Pinocchio and Candlewick discovered that they\n",
      "were both struck with the same misfortune, instead of feeling full of\n",
      "mortification and grief, they began to prick their ungainly ears and to\n",
      "make a thousand antics, and they ended by going into bursts of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they laughed, and laughed, and laughed, until they had to hold\n",
      "themselves together. But in the midst of their merriment Candlewick\n",
      "suddenly stopped, staggered, and, changing color, said to his friend:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help, help, Pinocchio!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas, I cannot any longer stand upright.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither can I,\" exclaimed Pinocchio, tottering and beginning to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst they were talking, they both doubled up and began to run\n",
      "round the room on their hands and feet. And as they ran, their hands\n",
      "became hoofs, their faces lengthened into muzzles, and their backs\n",
      "became covered with a light gray hairy coat sprinkled with black.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do you know what was the worst moment for these two wretched boys?\n",
      "The worst and the most humiliating moment was when their tails grew.\n",
      "Vanquished by shame and sorrow, they wept and lamented their fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, if they had but been wiser! But instead of sighs and lamentations\n",
      "they could only bray like asses; and they brayed loudly and said in\n",
      "chorus: \"Hee-haw!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst this was going on some one knocked at the door and a voice on the\n",
      "outside said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Open the door! I am the little man, I am the coachman who brought you\n",
      "to this country. Open at once, or it will be the worse for you!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding that the door remained shut the little man burst it open with a\n",
      "violent kick and, coming into the room, he said to Pinocchio and\n",
      "Candlewick with his usual little laugh:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well done, boys! You brayed well, and I recognized you by your voices.\n",
      "That is why I am here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words the two little donkeys were quite stupefied and stood\n",
      "with their heads down, their ears lowered, and their tails between their\n",
      "legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the little man stroked and caressed them; then, taking out a\n",
      "currycomb, he currycombed them well. And when by this process he had\n",
      "polished them till they shone like two mirrors, he put a halter round\n",
      "their necks and led them to the market-place, in hopes of selling them\n",
      "and making a good profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed buyers were not wanting. Candlewick was bought by a peasant\n",
      "whose donkey had died the previous day. Pinocchio was sold to the\n",
      "director of a company of buffoons and tight-rope dancers, who bought him\n",
      "that he might teach him to leap and to dance with the other animals\n",
      "belonging to the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, my little readers, you will have understood the fine trade that\n",
      "little man pursued. The wicked little monster, who had a face all milk\n",
      "and honey, made frequent journeys round the world with his coach. As he\n",
      "went along he collected, with promises and flattery, all the idle boys\n",
      "who had taken a dislike to books and school. As soon as his coach was\n",
      "full he conducted them to the \"Land of Boobies,\" that they might pass\n",
      "their time in games, in uproar, and in amusement. When these poor,\n",
      "deluded boys, from continual play and no study, had become so many\n",
      "little donkeys, he took possession of them with great delight and\n",
      "satisfaction, and carried them off to the fairs and markets to be sold.\n",
      "And in this way he had in a few years made heaps of money and had become\n",
      "a millionaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "What became of Candlewick I do not know, but I do know that Pinocchio\n",
      "from the very first day had to endure a very hard, laborious life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was put into his stall his master filled the manger with straw;\n",
      "but Pinocchio, having tried a mouthful, spat it out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then his master, grumbling, filled the manger with hay; but neither did\n",
      "the hay please him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" exclaimed his master in a passion. \"Does not hay please you\n",
      "either? Leave it to me, my fine donkey; if you are so full of caprices I\n",
      "will find a way to cure you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And by way of correcting him he struck his legs with his whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio began to cry and to bray with pain, and he said, braying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hee-haw! I cannot digest straw!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then eat hay!\" said his master, who understood perfectly the asinine\n",
      "dialect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hee-haw! hay gives me a pain in my stomach.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to pretend that a little donkey like you must be kept on\n",
      "breasts of chickens, and capons in jelly?\" asked his master, getting\n",
      "more and more angry, and whipping him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this second whipping Pinocchio prudently held his tongue and said\n",
      "nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stable was then shut and Pinocchio was left alone. He had not eaten\n",
      "for many hours and he began to yawn from hunger. And when he yawned he\n",
      "opened a mouth that seemed as wide as an oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, finding nothing else in the manger, he resigned himself and\n",
      "chewed a little hay; and after he had chewed it well, he shut his eyes\n",
      "and swallowed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This hay is not bad,\" he said to himself; \"but how much better it would\n",
      "have been if I had gone on with my studies! Instead of hay I might now\n",
      "be eating a hunch of new bread and a fine slice of sausage. But I must\n",
      "have patience!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning when he woke he looked in the manger for a little more\n",
      "hay; but he found none, for he had eaten it all during the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he took a mouthful of chopped straw, but whilst he was chewing it\n",
      "he had to acknowledge that the taste of chopped straw did not in the\n",
      "least resemble a savory dish of macaroni or pie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I must have patience!\" he repeated as he went on chewing. \"May my\n",
      "example serve at least as a warning to all disobedient boys who do not\n",
      "want to study. Patience!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Patience indeed!\" shouted his master, coming at that moment into the\n",
      "stable. \"Do you think, my little donkey, that I bought you only to give\n",
      "you food and drink? I bought you to make you work, and that you might\n",
      "earn money for me. Up, then, at once! you must come with me into the\n",
      "circus, and there I will teach you to jump through hoops, to go through\n",
      "frames of paper head foremost, to dance waltzes and polkas, and to stand\n",
      "upright on your hind legs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Pinocchio, either by love or by force, had to learn all these fine\n",
      "things. But it took him three months before he had learned them, and he\n",
      "got many a whipping that nearly took off his skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last a day came when his master was able to announce that he would\n",
      "give a really extraordinary representation. The many colored placards\n",
      "stuck on the street corners were thus worded:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On that evening, as you may imagine, an hour before the play was to\n",
      "begin the theater was crammed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was not a place to be had either in the pit or the stalls, or in\n",
      "the boxes even, by paying its weight in gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benches round the circus were crowded with children and with boys of\n",
      "all ages, who were in a fever of impatience to see the famous little\n",
      "donkey Pinocchio dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first part of the performance was over, the director of the\n",
      "company, dressed in a black coat, white breeches, and big leather boots\n",
      "that came above his knees, presented himself to the public, and, after\n",
      "making a profound bow, he began with much solemnity the following\n",
      "ridiculous speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Respectable public, ladies and gentlemen! The humble undersigned being\n",
      "a passer-by in this illustrious city, I have wished to procure for\n",
      "myself the honor, not to say the pleasure, of presenting to this\n",
      "intelligent and distinguished audience a celebrated little donkey, who\n",
      "has already had the honor of dancing in the presence of His Majesty the\n",
      "Emperor of all the principal courts of Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And, thanking you, I beg of you to help us with your inspiring presence\n",
      "and to be indulgent to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech was received with much laughter and applause, but the\n",
      "applause redoubled and became tumultuous when the little donkey\n",
      "Pinocchio made his appearance in the middle of the circus. He was decked\n",
      "out for the occasion. He had a new bridle of polished leather with brass\n",
      "buckles and studs, and two white camelias in his ears. His mane was\n",
      "divided and curled, and each curl was tied with bows of colored ribbon.\n",
      "He had a girth of gold and silver round his body, and his tail was\n",
      "plaited with amaranth and blue velvet ribbons. He was, in fact, a little\n",
      "donkey to fall in love with!\n",
      "\n",
      "The director, in presenting him to the public, added these few words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My respectable auditors! I am not here to tell you falsehoods of the\n",
      "great difficulties that I have overcome in understanding and subjugating\n",
      "this mammifer, whilst he was grazing at liberty amongst the mountains in\n",
      "the plains of the torrid zone. I beg you will observe the wild rolling\n",
      "of his eyes. Every means having been tried in vain to tame him, and to\n",
      "accustom him to the life of domestic quadrupeds, I was often forced to\n",
      "have recourse to the convincing argument of the whip. But all my\n",
      "goodness to him, instead of gaining his affections, has, on the\n",
      "contrary, increased his viciousness. However, following the system of\n",
      "Gall, I discovered in his cranium a bony cartilage that the Faculty of\n",
      "Medicine of Paris has itself recognized as the regenerating bulb of the\n",
      "hair, and of dance. For this reason I have not only taught him to dance,\n",
      "but also to jump through hoops and through frames covered with paper.\n",
      "Admire him, and then pass your opinion on him! But before taking my\n",
      "leave of you, permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to invite you to the\n",
      "daily performance that will take place tomorrow evening; but in case the\n",
      "weather should threaten rain, the performance will be postponed till\n",
      "tomorrow morning at 11 ante-meridian of post-meridian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the director made another profound bow, and, then turning to\n",
      "Pinocchio, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Courage, Pinocchio! before you begin your feats make your bow to this\n",
      "distinguished audience--ladies, gentlemen, and children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio obeyed, and bent both his knees till they touched the ground,\n",
      "and remained kneeling until the director, cracking his whip, shouted to\n",
      "him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At a foot's pace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the little donkey raised himself on his four legs and began to walk\n",
      "round the theater, keeping at a foot's pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little the director cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trot!\" and Pinocchio, obeying the order, changed to a trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gallop!\" and Pinocchio broke into a gallop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Full gallop!\" and Pinocchio went full gallop. But whilst he was going\n",
      "full speed like a race horse the director, raising his arm in the air,\n",
      "fired off a pistol.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the shot the little donkey, pretending to be wounded, fell his whole\n",
      "length in the circus, as if he were really dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he got up from the ground amidst an outburst of applause, shouts and\n",
      "clapping of hands, he naturally raised his head and looked up, and he\n",
      "saw in one of the boxes a beautiful lady who wore round her neck a thick\n",
      "gold chain from which hung a medallion. On the medallion was painted the\n",
      "portrait of a puppet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is my portrait! That lady is the Fairy!\" said Pinocchio to\n",
      "himself, recognizing her immediately; and, overcome with delight, he\n",
      "tried to cry:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my little Fairy! Oh, my little Fairy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But instead of these words a bray came from his throat, so sonorous and\n",
      "so prolonged that all the spectators laughed, and more especially all\n",
      "the children who were in the theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the director, to give him a lesson, and to make him understand that\n",
      "it is not good manners to bray before the public, gave him a blow on his\n",
      "nose with the handle of his whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor little donkey put his tongue out an inch and licked his nose\n",
      "for at least five minutes, thinking perhaps that it would ease the pain\n",
      "he felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what was his despair when, looking up a second time, he saw that the\n",
      "box was empty and that the Fairy had disappeared!\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he was going to die; his eyes filled with tears and he began\n",
      "to weep. Nobody, however, noticed it, and least of all the director who,\n",
      "cracking his whip, shouted:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Courage, Pinocchio! Now let the audience see how gracefully you can\n",
      "jump through the hoops.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio tried two or three times, but each time that he came in front\n",
      "of the hoop, instead of going through it, he found it easier to go under\n",
      "it. At last he made a leap and went through it, but his right leg\n",
      "unfortunately caught in the hoop, and that caused him to fall to the\n",
      "ground doubled up in a heap on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he got up he was lame and it was only with great difficulty that he\n",
      "managed to return to the stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring out Pinocchio! We want the little donkey! Bring out the little\n",
      "donkey!\" shouted all the boys in the theater, touched and sorry for the\n",
      "sad accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little donkey was seen no more that evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following morning the veterinary, that is, the doctor of animals,\n",
      "paid him a visit, and declared that he would remain lame for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The director then said to the stable-boy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you suppose I can do with a lame donkey? He would eat food\n",
      "without earning it. Take him to the market and sell him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the market a purchaser was found at once. He asked the\n",
      "stable-boy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much do you want for that lame donkey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twenty dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will give you two dollars. Don't suppose that I am buying him to make\n",
      "use of; I am buying him solely for his skin. I see that his skin is very\n",
      "hard and I intend to make a drum with it for the band of my village.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine poor Pinocchio's feelings when he heard that he was destined to\n",
      "become a drum!\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the purchaser had paid his two dollars he conducted the\n",
      "little donkey to the seashore. He then put a stone round his neck and,\n",
      "tying a rope, the end of which he held in his hand, round his leg, he\n",
      "gave him a sudden push and threw him into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio, weighted down by the stone, went at once to the bottom, and\n",
      "his owner, keeping tight hold of the cord, sat down quietly on a piece\n",
      "of rock to wait until the little donkey was drowned, intending then to\n",
      "skin him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After Pinocchio had been fifty minutes under the water, his purchaser\n",
      "said aloud to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor little lame donkey must by this time be quite drowned. I will\n",
      "therefore pull him out of the water, and I will make a fine drum of his\n",
      "skin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began to haul in the rope that he had tied to the donkey's leg,\n",
      "and he hauled, and hauled, and hauled, until at last--what do you think\n",
      "appeared above the water? Instead of a little dead donkey he saw a live\n",
      "puppet, who was wriggling like an eel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this wooden puppet, the poor man thought he was dreaming, and,\n",
      "struck dumb with astonishment, he remained with his mouth open and his\n",
      "eyes starting out of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having somewhat recovered from his first stupefaction, he asked in a\n",
      "quavering voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the little donkey that I threw into the sea? What has become of\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the little donkey!\" said Pinocchio, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, you young scamp!! Do you dare to make game of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To make game of you? Quite the contrary, my dear master? I am speaking\n",
      "seriously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how can you, who but a short time ago were a little donkey, have\n",
      "become a wooden puppet, only from having been left in the water?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must have been the effect of sea water. The sea makes extraordinary\n",
      "changes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beware, puppet, beware! Don't imagine that you can amuse yourself at my\n",
      "expense. Woe to you if I lose patience!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, master, do you wish to know the true story? If you will set my\n",
      "leg free I will tell it you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The good man, who was curious to hear the true story, immediately untied\n",
      "the knot that kept him bound; and Pinocchio, finding himself free as a\n",
      "bird in the air, commenced as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must know that I was once a puppet as I am now, and I was on the\n",
      "point of becoming a boy like the many who are in the world. But instead,\n",
      "induced by my dislike for study and the advice of bad companions, I ran\n",
      "away from home. One fine day when I awoke I found myself changed into a\n",
      "donkey with long ears, and a long tail. What a disgrace it was to\n",
      "me!--a disgrace, dear master, that even your worst enemy would not\n",
      "inflict upon you! Taken to the market to be sold I was bought by the\n",
      "director of an equestrian company, who took it into his head to make a\n",
      "famous dancer of me, and a famous leaper through hoops. But one night\n",
      "during a performance I had a bad fall in the circus and lamed both my\n",
      "legs. Then the director, not knowing what to do with a lame donkey, sent\n",
      "me to be sold, and you were the purchaser!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only too true. And I paid two dollars for you. And now, who will give\n",
      "me back my good money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why did you buy me? You bought me to make a drum of my skin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only too true! And now, where shall I find another skin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't despair, master. There are such a number of little donkeys in the\n",
      "world!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, you impertinent rascal, does your story end here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered the puppet; \"I have another two words to say and then I\n",
      "shall have finished. After you had bought me you brought me to this\n",
      "place to kill me; but then, yielding to a feeling of compassion, you\n",
      "preferred to tie a stone round my neck and to throw me into the sea.\n",
      "This humane feeling does you great honor and I shall always be grateful\n",
      "to you for it. But, nevertheless, dear master, this time you made your\n",
      "calculations without considering the Fairy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who is the Fairy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is my mamma and she resembles all other good mammas who care for\n",
      "their children, and who never lose sight of them, but help them\n",
      "lovingly, even when, on account of their foolishness and evil conduct,\n",
      "they deserve to be abandoned and left to themselves. Well, then, the\n",
      "good Fairy, as soon as she saw that I was in danger of drowning, sent\n",
      "immediately an immense shoal of fish, who, believing me really to be a\n",
      "little dead donkey, began to eat me. And what mouthfuls they took; I\n",
      "should never have thought that fish were greedier than boys! Some ate my\n",
      "ears, some my muzzle, others my neck and mane, some the skin of my legs,\n",
      "some my coat. Amongst them there was a little fish so polite that he\n",
      "even condescended to eat my tail.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From this time forth,\" said his purchaser, horrified, \"I swear that I\n",
      "will never touch fish. It would be too dreadful to open a mullet, or a\n",
      "fried whiting, and to find inside a donkey's tail!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I agree with you,\" said the puppet, laughing. \"However, I must tell you\n",
      "that when the fish had finished eating the donkey's hide that covered me\n",
      "from head to foot, they naturally reached the bone, or rather the wood,\n",
      "for, as you see, I am made of the hardest wood. But after giving a few\n",
      "bites they soon discovered that I was not a morsel for their teeth, and,\n",
      "disgusted with such indigestible food, they went off, some in one\n",
      "direction and some in another, without so much as saying 'Thank you' to\n",
      "me. And now, at last, I have told you how it was that when you pulled up\n",
      "the rope you found a live puppet instead of a dead donkey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I laugh at your story,\" cried the man in a rage. \"I know only that I\n",
      "spent two dollars to buy you, and I will have my money back. Shall I\n",
      "tell you what I will do? I will take you back to the market and I will\n",
      "sell you by weight as seasoned wood for lighting fires.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sell me if you like; I am content,\" said Pinocchio.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he said it he made a spring and plunged into the water. Swimming\n",
      "gaily away from the shore, he called to his poor owner:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, master; if you should be in want of a skin to make a drum,\n",
      "remember me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he laughed and went on swimming, and after a while he turned again\n",
      "and shouted louder:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, master; if you should be in want of a little well seasoned\n",
      "wood for lighting the fire, remember me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the twinkling of an eye he had swum so far off that he was scarcely\n",
      "visible. All that could be seen of him was a little black speck on the\n",
      "surface of the sea that from time to time lifted its legs out of the\n",
      "water and leaped and capered like a dolphin enjoying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst Pinocchio was swimming, he knew not whither, he saw in the midst\n",
      "of the sea a rock that seemed to be made of white marble, and on the\n",
      "summit there stood a beautiful little goat who bleated lovingly and made\n",
      "signs to him to approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the most singular thing was this. The little goat's hair, instead of\n",
      "being white or black, or a mixture of two colors as is usual with other\n",
      "goats, was blue, and a very vivid blue, greatly resembling the hair of\n",
      "the beautiful Child.\n",
      "\n",
      "I leave you to imagine how rapidly poor Pinocchio's heart began to beat.\n",
      "He swam with redoubled strength and energy towards the white rock; and\n",
      "he was already half-way there when he saw, rising up out of the water\n",
      "and coming to meet him, the horrible head of a sea-monster. His\n",
      "wide-open, cavernous mouth and his three rows of enormous teeth would\n",
      "have been terrifying to look at even in a picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you know what this sea-monster was?\n",
      "\n",
      "This sea-monster was neither more nor less than that gigantic Dog-Fish,\n",
      "who has been mentioned many times in this story, and who, for his\n",
      "slaughter and for his insatiable voracity, had been named the \"Attila of\n",
      "Fish and Fishermen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Only to think of poor Pinocchio's terror at the sight of the monster. He\n",
      "tried to avoid it, to change his direction; he tried to escape, but that\n",
      "immense, wide-open mouth came towards him with the velocity of an arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be quick, Pinocchio, for pity's sake!\" cried the beautiful little goat,\n",
      "bleating.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Pinocchio swam desperately with his arms, his chest, his legs, and\n",

      "\"That is bad, puppet,\" answered the gardener. \"If you have not even one\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I must have patience!\" said Pinocchio, and he turned to go.\n",

      "\"It is a bargain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giangio then led Pinocchio to the kitchen garden and taught him how to\n",
      "turn the pumping machine. Pinocchio immediately began to work; but\n",
      "before he had drawn up the hundred buckets of water the perspiration was\n",
      "pouring from his head to his feet. Never before had he undergone such\n",
      "fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up till now,\" said the gardener, \"the labor of turning the pumping\n",
      "machine was performed by my little donkey, but the poor animal is\n",
      "dying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you take me to see him?\" said Pinocchio.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am sure I know this little donkey! His face is not new to me.\"\n",

      "\"Who are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this question the little donkey opened his dying eyes, and answered\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am--Can--dle--wick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, having again closed his eyes, he expired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, poor Candlewick!\" said Pinocchio in a low voice; and, taking a\n",
      "handful of straw, he dried a tear that was rolling down his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you grieve for a donkey that cost you nothing?\" said the gardener.\n",
      "\"What must it be to me, who bought him for ready money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must tell you--he was my friend!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of my school-fellows!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\" shouted Giangio, laughing loudly. \"How? had you donkeys for\n",
      "school-fellows? I can imagine what wonderful studies you must have\n",
      "made!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The puppet, who felt much mortified at these words, did not answer; but,\n",
      "taking his tumbler of milk, still quite warm, he returned to the hut.\n",
      "\n",
      "And from that day for more than five months he continued to get up at\n",
      "daybreak every morning to go and turn the pumping machine, to earn the\n",
      "tumbler of milk that was of such benefit to his father in his bad state\n",
      "of health. Nor was he satisfied with this; for, during the time that he\n",
      "had over, he learned to make hampers and baskets of rushes, and with the\n",
      "money he obtained by selling them he was able with great economy to\n",
      "provide for all the daily expenses. Amongst other things he constructed\n",
      "an elegant little wheel-chair, in which he could take his father out on\n",
      "fine days to breathe a mouthful of fresh air.\n",
      "\n",
      "By his industry, ingenuity and his anxiety to work and to overcome\n",
      "difficulties, he not only succeeded in maintaining his father, who\n",
      "continued infirm, in comfort, but he also contrived to put aside five\n",
      "dollars to buy himself a new coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning he said to his father:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to the neighboring market to buy myself a jacket, a cap, and\n",
      "a pair of shoes. When I return,\" he added, laughing, \"I shall be so well\n",
      "dressed that you will take me for a fine gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, leaving the house, he began to run merrily and happily along. All\n",
      "at once he heard himself called by name and, turning around, he saw a\n",
      "big Snail crawling out from the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not know me?\" asked the Snail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems to me--and yet I am not sure--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not remember the Snail who was lady's-maid to the Fairy with\n",
      "blue hair? Do you not remember the time when I came downstairs to let\n",
      "you in, and you were caught by your foot, which you had stuck through\n",
      "the house-door?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember it all\" shouted Pinocchio. \"Tell me quickly, my beautiful\n",
      "little Snail, where have you left my good Fairy? What is she doing? Has\n",
      "she forgiven me? Does she still remember me? Does she still wish me\n",
      "well? Is she far from here? Can I go and see her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To all these rapid, breathless questions the Snail replied in her usual\n",
      "phlegmatic manner:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Pinocchio, the poor Fairy is lying in bed at the hospital!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the hospital?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is only too true. Overtaken by a thousand misfortunes, she has\n",
      "fallen seriously ill, and she has not even enough to buy herself a\n",
      "mouthful of bread.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it really so? Oh, what sorrow you have given me! Oh, poor Fairy!\n",
      "Poor Fairy! Poor Fairy! If I had a million I would run and carry it to\n",
      "her, but I have only five dollars. Here they are--I was going to buy a\n",
      "new coat. Take them, Snail, and carry them at once to my good Fairy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And your new coat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What matters my new coat? I would sell even these rags that I have on\n",
      "to be able to help her. Go, Snail, and be quick; and in two days return\n",
      "to this place, for I hope I shall then be able to give you some more\n",
      "money. Up to this time I have worked to maintain my papa; from today I\n",
      "will work five hours more that I may also maintain my good mamma.\n",
      "Good-bye, Snail, I shall expect you in two days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Snail, contrary to her usual habits, began to run like a lizard in a\n",
      "hot August sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening Pinocchio, instead of going to bed at ten o'clock, sat up\n",
      "till midnight had struck; and instead of making eight baskets of rushes\n",
      "he made sixteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went to bed and fell asleep. And whilst he slept he thought that\n",
      "he saw the Fairy, smiling and beautiful, who, after having kissed him,\n",
      "said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well done, Pinocchio! To reward you for your good heart I will forgive\n",
      "you for all that is past. Boys who minister tenderly to their parents\n",
      "and assist them in their misery and infirmities, are deserving of great\n",
      "praise and affection, even if they cannot be cited as examples of\n",
      "obedience and good behavior. Try and do better in the future and you\n",
      "will be happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment his dream ended and Pinocchio opened his eyes and awoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "But imagine his astonishment when upon awakening he discovered that he\n",
      "was no longer a wooden puppet, but that he had become instead a boy,\n",
      "like all other boys. He gave a glance round and saw that the straw walls\n",
      "of the hut had disappeared, and that he was in a pretty little room\n",
      "furnished and arranged with a simplicity that was almost elegance.\n",
      "Jumping out of bed he found a new suit of clothes ready for him, a new\n",
      "cap, and a pair of new boots, that fitted him beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was hardly dressed when he naturally put his hands in his pockets\n",
      "and pulled out a little ivory purse on which these words were written:\n",
      "\"The Fairy with blue hair returns the five dollars to her dear\n",
      "Pinocchio, and thanks him for his good heart.\" He opened the purse and\n",
      "instead of five dollars he saw fifty shining gold pieces fresh from the\n",
      "mint.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went and looked at himself in the glass, and he thought he was\n",
      "some one else. For he no longer saw the usual reflection of a wooden\n",
      "puppet; he was greeted instead by the image of a bright, intelligent boy\n",
      "with chestnut hair, blue eyes, and looking as happy and joyful as if it\n",
      "were the Easter holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of all these wonders succeeding each other, Pinocchio felt\n",
      "quite bewildered, and he could not tell if he was really awake or if he\n",
      "was dreaming with his eyes open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where can my papa be?\" he exclaimed suddenly, and, going into the next\n",
      "room, he found old Geppetto quite well, lively, and in good humor, just\n",
      "as he had been formerly. He had already resumed his trade of\n",
      "wood-carving, and he was designing a rich and beautiful frame of leaves,\n",
      "flowers and the heads of animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Satisfy my curiosity, dear papa,\" said Pinocchio, throwing his arms\n",
      "around his neck and covering him with kisses; \"how can this sudden\n",
      "change be accounted for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This sudden change in our home is all your doing,\" answered Geppetto.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How my doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because when boys who have behaved badly turn over a new leaf and\n",
      "become good, they have the power of bringing contentment and happiness\n",
      "to their families.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And where has the old wooden Pinocchio hidden himself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There he is,\" answered Geppetto, and he pointed to a big puppet\n",
      "leaning against a chair, with its head on one side, its arms dangling,\n",
      "and its legs so crossed and bent that it was really a miracle that it\n",
      "remained standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinocchio turned and looked at it; and, after he had looked at it for a\n",
